We conducted a mixed-methods study with 16 participants with visual or motor impairments to understand their experiences with VUIs.

We analyzed 45 papers published between 2010 and 2020, focusing on design considerations, user experiences, and challenges. Our findings indicate that while VUIs can enhance independence for older adults, current designs often do not adequately address age-related changes in cognition, hearing, and speech production.

    "text": "Exercising identificaiton of Research Gap - Abstract Three\nFind the actual research gap sentence FIRST. Find the ACTUAL research gap between the three after.\n\nFrom “Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Voice User Interface Design” (Kim & Martinez, 2022, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction):\n\n\n“Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are becoming global products, yet their design often reflects Western cultural norms. This study examines VUI preferences across three cultures: American, Korean, and Brazilian. Through surveys (n=300) and interviews (n=30), we found significant differences in command phrasing, error recovery strategies, and personification preferences. However, current VUI design frameworks do not adequately account for these cultural variations, potentially leading to reduced usability and user satisfaction in non-Western contexts. We propose a culturally adaptive VUI design model and highlight areas for future cross-cultural VUI research.”"
