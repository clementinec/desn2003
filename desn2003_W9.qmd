<!-- ## Recapping on Literature Review
- Grades & Comments published on Moodle
- Major reasons that the grades may not appear to be satisfying:
  - formatting is off
  - recounting, synthesis are in, but critical lens are missing
    - question literature if you could
  - if you need any clarifications feel free to reach out to me for time to catch up next week on this during office hour
    - we may arrange in-class seminar session if demands are high enough

## Group Project Example
  - Already posted on Moodle
  - Quick walk-through lookouts:
    - framework
    - contents that are expected
    - just an example so not the final 'solution manual' that you will need to follow
    - typical length that is expected, so nothing major
    - demonstrates how you have leveraged techniques learnt in this class to investigate problems at hand
  - Let's take a quick look -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** descriptive from analytical writing in your own drafts
2. **Apply** reverse outlining to identify structural gaps
3. **Synthesize** qualitative and quantitative findings using the Synthesis Canvas
4. **Translate** research findings into product hypotheses (Applied Research)

---

## Today's Session Structure

## Task of the day 1

  1. Find your initial team mates;
  2. work out an initial list (excel/Google Sheet) version of top 3 candidates;
  3. You have 15 minutes;
  4. You are not expected to go very deep with social engineering, but 
  5. Selection of candidates should be justified through the excel;
  5. Possible columns can be why you picked them, star project, most recent interview, etc. and preference rank. -->

<!-- # Methodology (Due 11:59 AM Mar 31st) -->

<!-- ## Circling back to Methodology Examples in Google Drive

- Refer to W8 folder
- Refer to the two papers for methodology framework inspirations aka 'formatting'
  - "Stuck in the stack" & "Air vs. MRT"
  - What level of details did these papers ended up providing in their methodology section?
  - Are they connected somehow to the literature review/background+introduction sections as well?
  - _But what if my methodologies are not natural-science-related?_
- Tutorial/Instruction Manual-like spirit

## Why do people have write a methodology section in research papers?
  - We previously discussed **what** are the typical methodologies out there that supports research as a given.
  - Reserach is ultimately meant for pushing boundaries:
    - 'dissemination'  (dissemination)
      - clarify extent and specifics of the published work
    - '**reproducible**' (repeatable)
      - allow readers to repeat the publication -->

## Descriptive vs. Analytical Writing

Welcome to today's session on distinguishing between descriptive and analytical writing. Let's enhance our academic writing skills together!

::: notes
In this session, we'll explore the key differences between descriptive and analytical writing, which are crucial for academic success, especially in fields like UI/UX and product design.
:::


## Activity: Identify the Writing Style

We'll go through several examples. For each, determine if it's descriptive or analytical. After your response, we'll reveal the correct answer and discuss.

::: notes
This interactive activity aims to help students practice distinguishing between descriptive and analytical writing through real examples.
:::

## Example 1: Question

"User engagement metrics have decreased by 20% over the past three months."

**Question:**  
Is this statement **descriptive** or **analytical**?

::: notes
This statement simply presents a fact without interpretation. Think: Does it explain why or how?
:::

---

## Example 1: Answer

**Answer:** Descriptive

*Explanation:*  
The sentence reports a fact (a 20% drop) without delving into any reasons or implications behind the metric change.

---

## Example 2: Question

"Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a psychological theory that arranges human needs in a pyramid, with physiological needs at the base and self-actualization at the top."

**Question:**  
Is this statement **descriptive** or **analytical**?

::: notes
It describes the theory’s structure, but it doesn't critically assess its limitations or context.
:::

---

## Example 2: Answer

**Answer:** Descriptive

*Explanation:*  
While it explains the pyramid structure, it does not analyze or critique the theory’s applicability or limitations across different cultures.

---

## Example 3: Question

"The experiment demonstrated that plants exposed to sunlight grew faster than those kept in the shade."

**Question:**  
Is this statement **descriptive** or **analytical**?

::: notes
It reports the outcome of an experiment without explaining the underlying reasons.
:::

---

## Example 3: Answer

**Answer:** Descriptive

*Explanation:*  
The statement provides an observation (faster growth with sunlight) without discussing the process or significance of the finding.

---

## Example 4: Question

"In Shakespeare's 'Macbeth,' Lady Macbeth's manipulation of her husband's actions serves as a commentary on the corrupting power of unchecked ambition and challenges traditional gender roles in Shakespearean society."

**Question:**  
Is this statement **descriptive** or **analytical**?

::: notes
This statement goes beyond merely describing; it interprets the role of Lady Macbeth to reveal broader themes.
:::

---

## Example 4: Answer

**Answer:** Analytical

*Explanation:*  
It not only identifies Lady Macbeth’s influence but also interprets her actions as a critique of societal norms, thus offering analytical insight.

---

## Example 5: Question

"Survey results show that 60% of respondents prefer online shopping over in-store shopping."

**Question:**  
Is this statement **descriptive** or **analytical**?

::: notes
Consider if the sentence just states the data or explores reasons behind the preference.
:::

---

## Example 5: Answer

**Answer:** Descriptive

*Explanation:*  
It presents a statistic without discussing why users might prefer online shopping or its implications for consumer behavior.

---

## Example 6: Question

"While the interface layout includes a navigation bar, a content area, and a footer, this design might impede user engagement if it fails to prioritize the most critical user tasks, suggesting a need for a more dynamic, behavior-driven layout."

**Question:**  
Is this statement **descriptive** or **analytical**?

::: notes
Notice how this sentence not only describes the interface components but also evaluates their impact on user engagement.
:::

---

## Example 6: Answer

**Answer:** Analytical

*Explanation:*  
The statement goes beyond description by assessing the potential drawbacks of the layout and suggesting improvements based on user behavior.

## Key Takeaways

- **Descriptive vs. Analytical:**  
  - *Descriptive writing* states facts or observations.  
  - *Analytical writing* explains the significance, reasoning, and implications behind those facts.
  
- **Depth of Analysis:**  
  - Effective academic writing connects evidence with critical interpretation.  
  - Always ask: "Why is this important?" and "What does this mean for the overall argument?"

- **Practical Strategies for Improvement:**  
  - **Peer Review:** Leverage feedback from classmates to identify areas lacking analysis.  
  - **Reverse Outlining:** Break down your text to pinpoint descriptive versus analytical sections.

- **Continuous Revision:**  
  - Use these insights to refine your drafts, deepening your analysis and improving clarity.

::: notes
These key points emphasize the critical differences between descriptive and analytical writing. Remember, the goal is to transform simple statements into a compelling argument by integrating evidence, interpretation, and reflection. Use peer review and reverse outlining as tools to uncover and address any gaps in your analysis.
:::

## Enhancing Your Analytical Writing

**Objective:**  
- Develop your analytical writing skills by examining and revising your literature review or methodology sections.  
- Engage in collaborative activities to practice critical analysis.

**Today’s Activities:**  
1. **Peer Review:** In pairs, analyze each other's writing using guided questions.  
2. **Reverse Outlining:** Break down a text (yours or a provided sample) to identify strengths and gaps.

::: notes
In this session, we'll focus on moving beyond descriptive writing into deep, analytical writing. You have the option to work on your own work or use a sample provided by me.
:::

---

## Stage 1: Peer Review Activity

**Time:** 25 minutes

**Instructions:**  

1. **Pair Up:** Find a partner in the room.
2. **Exchange Materials:** Share your literature review or methodology section (or use the provided sample).
3. **Guided Review:** Use these questions as you read your partner’s work:
   - **Thesis & Argument:**  
     - Is the thesis clear and arguable?
     - Does the argument show critical evaluation rather than just stating facts?
   - **Use of Evidence:**  
     - Is evidence well integrated and analyzed?
     - Does the writer explain the significance of each piece of evidence?
   - **Structure & Flow:**  
     - Are the ideas presented logically?
     - Do transitions connect the analysis throughout the paper?

**Goal:**  
- Provide constructive feedback focused on deepening the analysis.

::: notes
As you review, think critically: Are the claims supported by analysis or just stated? Focus on suggesting ways to integrate evidence and clarify your argument.
:::

---

## Stage 2: Reverse Outlining Exercise

**Time:** 25 minutes

**Instructions:**  

1. **Choose Your Text:** Pick a section from the previously worked-upon example you looked at (4-5 paragraphs max).
2. **Number Each Paragraph:** Number the paragraphs in the margin for clarity.
3. **Summarize Each Paragraph:** In one sentence, capture the main idea or argument of each paragraph.
4. **Evaluate the Outline:**  
   - Does each summary contribute to your overall argument?  
   - Identify any parts that are merely descriptive rather than analytical.
5. **Plan Revisions:** Mark paragraphs that need more critical insight or better integration of evidence.

**Goal:**  
- Reveal the structure and flow of your argument and present to each other.
- Identify areas where you can add deeper analysis or clarity.

::: notes
Reverse outlining is a fantastic way to "step back" and see if your paragraphs are advancing your argument. Look for any gaps where analysis is missing, and consider how you can connect ideas more cohesively.
:::

## Reflection & Discussion

**Discussion Questions:**  
- What new insights did you gain about your own writing from these activities?  
- How can the feedback from your peer review inform your revisions?  
- What specific changes will you make to improve the analytical depth of your paper?

**Next Steps:**  
- Revise your draft based on the insights and feedback received.
- Schedule a follow-up session if you need additional support on integrating analytical writing techniques.

::: notes
Feel free to share your reflections with the class. This discussion will help you and your peers learn from one another’s experiences and insights. Remember, the aim is not just to correct, but to deepen your understanding of analytical writing.
:::

## Double-check your submission to make sure that it can be considered a followable instruction manual by the domain experts.

# Synthesis Activity {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Using the Synthesis Canvas (25 min)

**The challenge:** You have findings from multiple sources. How do you bring them together?

- Qualitative themes from interviews
- Quantitative patterns from surveys
- Insights from literature

**The tool:** [Synthesis Canvas (PDF)](data/synthesis_canvas.pdf)

---

## Activity: Complete Your Synthesis Canvas

**Step 1: What Data Do You Have?** (3 min)

Fill in Section 1 of the canvas:
- What qualitative data? (interviews, observations, open-ended responses)
- What quantitative data? (survey scores, analytics, measurements)
- How much of each?

---

## Activity: Qualitative Synthesis (10 min)

**Step 2: Pull Key Quotes**

From your interviews/observations, identify 3-5 powerful quotes that capture key insights.

**Step 3: Group Into Themes**

Cluster related quotes. Name each theme. Note how many participants expressed it.

| Theme | Codes Included | # of Participants |
|:------|:---------------|:------------------|
| Theme 1: _________ | _________ | ___/___ |
| Theme 2: _________ | _________ | ___/___ |

---

## Activity: Triangulation Check (7 min)

**Step 4: Do Qual and Quant Agree?**

For each finding, check:

| Finding | Qual Evidence | Quant Evidence | Agreement? |
|:--------|:--------------|:---------------|:-----------|
| _________ | _________ | _________ | Yes / No / Partial |

**If they disagree:** That's interesting data. Write down why they might differ.

---

## Activity: The "So What?" (5 min)

**Step 5: Why Should Anyone Care?**

For your top 2-3 findings, write one sentence explaining the implication:

| Finding | So What? |
|:--------|:---------|
| _________ | This means... / This suggests... / Designers should consider... |

**If you can't answer "so what?" — the finding isn't ready for Doc 1.**

---

## Architecture/Urban Example: Synthesizing Mixed Methods Data

**Research question:** Does greenery in Hong Kong's elevated walkways affect pedestrian stress levels?

| Data Type | Source | Key Finding |
|:----------|:-------|:------------|
| **Qualitative** | 10 walking interviews | "The plants make it feel less like a tunnel" (7/10) |
| **Quantitative** | Heart rate variability (N=45) | 12% lower stress markers in green sections vs. bare sections |
| **Observation** | Pedestrian counts | 23% more people paused/lingered in green sections |

**Triangulation:** All three methods converge — greenery correlates with lower stress and changed behavior.

**So what?** Urban designers should prioritize vegetation in elevated walkway design; the effect is measurable, not just aesthetic preference.

# Research → Decision Framework {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Applied Research (Builder-Maker) Focus

This section is specifically for students on the **Applied Research track** who are building design case studies or product recommendations. If you're on the Frontier Research track, this framework shows how industry applies research — useful context even if your output is a traditional paper.
:::

## The Product Builder's Challenge

You've done your research. You found the behavioral science. Now what?

**Academic output:** "Our findings suggest that social comparison mediates the relationship between like-checking frequency and anxiety (β = 0.38, p < .001)."

**Product question:** "Should we hide like counts? Will it actually help? How will we know?"

This section bridges that gap.

## The Translation Problem

| What Research Gives You | What Product Needs |
|:------------------------|:-------------------|
| Correlations & themes | Causal hypotheses |
| General principles | Specific feature specs |
| "This is happening" | "If we do X, Y will happen" |
| Academic language | Stakeholder-ready framing |

**Your job:** Turn "what we know" into "what we should build and why we expect it to work."

## The Research → Decision Canvas

| Component | Question | Your Answer |
|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| **Scientific Foundation** | What does behavioral science say about this problem? | _____________ |
| **Product Hypothesis** | If we build [feature], then [outcome] because [mechanism] | _____________ |
| **Expected Effect** | How big a change do we expect? What's the baseline? | _____________ |
| **Success Metric** | How will we measure if it worked? | _____________ |
| **Risk if Wrong** | What happens if our hypothesis is wrong? | _____________ |
| **Validation Plan** | How will we test before full launch? | _____________ |

## Worked Example: Instagram Hidden Likes

**Research finding:** Social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) + your qualitative data showing 9/12 participants check likes to compare with friends.

| Component | Answer |
|:----------|:-------|
| **Scientific Foundation** | Social comparison drives anxiety; visible metrics enable comparison; removing visibility should reduce comparison triggers |
| **Product Hypothesis** | If we hide like counts from viewers, then comparison-driven anxiety will decrease, because users can't compare their posts to others' |
| **Expected Effect** | Baseline: 67% report checking to compare. Target: <40% report comparison motivation after hiding. |
| **Success Metric** | Self-reported comparison frequency (survey); anxiety scale (GAD-7); qualitative interviews |
| **Risk if Wrong** | Users might feel less validated, reducing posting motivation; engagement metrics might drop |
| **Validation Plan** | A/B test with 10% of users for 4 weeks; exit survey + 10 interviews |

## Case Study: Duolingo's Streak Feature

**The science:** Loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) — people are more motivated to avoid losing something than to gain something of equal value.

**The translation:**

| Component | Duolingo's Answer |
|:----------|:------------------|
| **Scientific Foundation** | Loss aversion: losing a streak feels worse than gaining a day |
| **Product Hypothesis** | If we visualize consecutive-day streaks, users will practice daily to avoid "losing" their streak |
| **Expected Effect** | Daily active users should increase; session frequency should stabilize |
| **Success Metric** | DAU/MAU ratio; 7-day retention; streak length distribution |
| **Risk if Wrong** | Users might feel punished by broken streaks and churn |
| **Validation Plan** | Introduced incrementally; added "streak freeze" as safety valve |

**Result:** Streaks became Duolingo's core retention mechanism.

## Case Study: Spotify Wrapped

**The science:** Self-presentation theory (Goffman, 1959) — people curate identity through what they share; nostalgia increases emotional engagement.

**The translation:**

| Component | Spotify's Answer |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| **Scientific Foundation** | Sharing music = identity signaling; year-end reflection = nostalgia; social proof drives adoption |
| **Product Hypothesis** | If we create shareable, personalized year-in-review content, users will spread it organically, driving brand awareness and emotional connection |
| **Expected Effect** | Viral social sharing in December; increased premium conversions post-Wrapped |
| **Success Metric** | Social shares; hashtag volume; December premium signups vs. baseline |
| **Risk if Wrong** | Users might find it creepy or ignore it |
| **Validation Plan** | Started with simple stats; iterated based on what got shared most |

**Result:** Wrapped became Spotify's biggest annual marketing moment — built on behavioral science, not ad spend.

## When Your Research Says "Don't Build It"

Sometimes research reveals your hypothesis is wrong. That's valuable.

**Signals to reconsider:**

- Literature shows the mechanism doesn't work the way you thought
- Qualitative data shows users don't actually have the problem you assumed
- Comparable products tried it and failed (with documented reasons)
- The effect size in existing research is too small to matter

**What to do:**

1. Document why you're not building it (prevents revisiting the same dead end)
2. Look for adjacent opportunities the research revealed
3. Share with stakeholders — "We saved X months by researching first"

## What Product Research Output Looks Like

**Not a paper.** A decision document.

**Structure:**

1. **The Opportunity** (1 paragraph): What problem are we solving? For whom?
2. **What We Learned** (1 page): Key findings from research — qual themes, quant patterns, literature insights
3. **Our Hypothesis** (1 paragraph): If we build X, then Y, because Z
4. **Recommendation** (1 paragraph): Build / Don't build / Test first
5. **Validation Plan** (if building): How we'll know if we're right
6. **Appendix**: Raw data, quotes, methodology details

**Length:** 2-3 pages + appendix. Readable in 10 minutes.

## The Screenshot-Worthy Slide

::: {.callout-tip}
## Research → Decision in One Sentence

**"We found [scientific principle] in the literature and [pattern] in our data, which suggests that if we build [feature], users will [outcome] — and we'll measure success by [metric]."**
:::

**Example:**

> "We found that loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky) predicts people work harder to protect what they have than to gain something new. Our interviews confirmed users hate 'losing progress.' This suggests that if we add a visible streak counter, users will practice daily to avoid breaking it — and we'll measure success by 7-day retention rate."
