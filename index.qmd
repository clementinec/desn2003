A foundational course in research methodology for design practice. We explore how rigorous inquiry informs innovation—from framing questions to gathering evidence and communicating findings.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Course's Core Question
Can you distinguish **incremental improvement** from **genuine innovation**? Research methodology gives you the tools to tell the difference — and to pursue whichever path you choose deliberately.
:::

**Two Tracks, One Methodology:**

| **Frontier Research (Technologist)** | **Applied Research (Builder-Maker)** |
|:--|:--|
| For students who want to push the frontier: research questions at the edge of design, science, or engineering, written in peer-review style with rigorous methods and clear contributions. | For students who want to turn research into something buildable: evidence → insight → recommendation → validation plan. Same rigor, different audience. |

Choose based on your interests. Same methodology. Same skills. Different framing. See the [Assessment Guide](assessment.qmd) for how each document applies to your track.
