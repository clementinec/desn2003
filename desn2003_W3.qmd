## Hint
Your Instagram feature idea could be the seed for this—but you'll need to know what's already out there first.
:::

# The Question We Left Open {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## How Thorough Was Your Search?

Last week, you checked if your Instagram feature exists in competitor apps.

. . .

**But did you really know the landscape?**

::: {.incremental}
- Did you check *all* competitors, or just the ones you use?
- Did you find out if Instagram tried this before and killed it?
- Do you know *why* similar features succeeded or failed elsewhere?
- Is there research on this type of feature?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## The Risk
If you don't map what exists, you might "innovate" something that already failed—or reinvent what already works.
:::

## Today's Goal: Learn to Map the Landscape

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Industry Approach
**Competitive Analysis**

- What do competitors offer?
- What's the feature history?
- What do users say about existing solutions?
- What have companies tried and abandoned?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Academic Approach
**Literature Review**

- What does research say?
- What theories explain user behavior?
- What methods have been tested?
- What gaps remain unstudied?
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Both Serve the Same Goal
Know what exists before claiming your idea is new.
:::

# Part 1: Competitive Analysis {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## What Is Competitive Analysis?

A systematic examination of similar products/features to understand:

::: {.incremental}
- **What exists:** Features, approaches, solutions already in market
- **What works:** Successful implementations and why
- **What failed:** Abandoned features, pivots, user backlash
- **What's missing:** Gaps that remain unfilled
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## For Your Instagram Feature
Before proposing a "new" feature, you need to know: Has this been tried? Does it exist elsewhere? Why or why not?
:::

---

## The Competitive Landscape for Social Media

**Direct Competitors:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- TikTok, Snapchat, BeReal, YouTube Shorts, X/Twitter, Threads, WeChat, LINE
:::

**Adjacent Products:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Pinterest (visual discovery), Discord (community), WhatsApp (messaging), Notion (sharing)
:::

**Historical Context:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Vine (dead), Google+ (dead), Clubhouse (declined), Periscope (absorbed)
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## The Graveyard Matters
Failed products and killed features tell you what *didn't* work—often more valuable than successes.
:::

---

## Sources for Competitive Analysis

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Product Intelligence:**

- App Store / Play Store (features, reviews, update history)
- Product Hunt (launch announcements)
- TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired (feature coverage)
- Company blogs and newsrooms
- Wayback Machine (historical snapshots)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**User Sentiment:**

- App reviews (1-star reviews are gold)
- Reddit communities (r/Instagram, r/socialmedia)
- Twitter/X complaints and wishlists
- YouTube reviews and comparisons
- Designer/developer forums
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Pro Tip
Search "[feature name] + failed" or "[app name] + removed feature" to find the graveyard.
:::

---

## Competitive Analysis Framework

For each competitor/feature, document:

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| **What is it?** | Feature name, how it works, when launched |
| **Who uses it?** | Target users, use cases |
| **How well does it work?** | User reception, ratings, complaints |
| **What's the trajectory?** | Growing? Stagnant? Killed? |
| **Why does it matter for your idea?** | Validates gap? Invalidates it? Inspires iteration? |

. . .

This becomes your **competitive landscape map**—the foundation for knowing if your gap is real.

---

## Quick Exercise: Map Your Feature's Landscape (10 min)

**In pairs, for your Instagram feature idea:**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. List 3 competitors that might have something similar
2. Do a quick search: Does this feature (or something close) exist?
3. If yes: How is it implemented? What do users say?
4. If no: Why might that be? (Technical? Strategic? No demand?)
5. What did you learn that changes your thinking?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Share Out
Be ready to report: Did your gap survive the competitive check?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Circulate and help with search strategies
- Push them to look beyond obvious competitors
- Note interesting findings for class discussion
:::

---

## Debrief: What Did the Landscape Reveal?

::: {.incremental}
- Did anyone discover their feature already exists?
- Did anyone find a failed attempt at something similar?
- Did anyone's gap get *stronger* after seeing what competitors lack?
- What surprised you?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Insight
Competitive analysis doesn't kill ideas—it **refines** them. Now you know what to differentiate from.
:::

# Part 2: From Industry to Academy {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Competitive Analysis Is Not Enough

You've mapped the product landscape. But there's more:

::: {.incremental}
- **Why** do certain features succeed psychologically?
- **What theories** explain user behavior in this space?
- **What research methods** have been used to study this?
- **What do experts know** that practitioners haven't applied yet?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Gap Between Industry and Academy
Companies move fast and often don't read research. Academics study deeply but publish slowly. **Your advantage:** You can bridge both.
:::

---

## Literature Review: The Academic Landscape Map

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Literature =
The body of knowledge in any discipline:

- Theoretical frameworks
- Empirical studies
- Practical applications
- Relevant investigations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Review =
Knowledge organized to show:

- What's known
- What's debated
- What's missing
- Why YOUR study adds value
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Think of It This Way
Competitive analysis maps **products**. Literature review maps **knowledge**.
:::

---

## Why Literature Review Matters

::: {.incremental}
- **Understand the research landscape**—what's been studied, what hasn't
- **Avoid repetitive work**—don't "discover" what's already known
- **Build on existing theory**—your work stands on others' shoulders
- **Identify research gaps**—where can YOU contribute?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Connection to Your Feature Idea
Maybe your feature addresses a gap that researchers have *already identified* but industry hasn't solved yet. Literature review helps you find that.
:::

---

## Two Phases of Literature Review

**Phase One: Catch-them-all**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Identify all relevant publications within your problem space
- Read/skim through and broaden your understanding
- Critique how/why some are (not) adequate in what they claim
:::

. . .

**Phase Two: Write on Relevance**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Synthesize findings into coherent writing
- Present **your own evaluation**—both strengths and weaknesses
- Create a roadmap showing how your work fits in
:::

---

## What Literature Review Provides

A stock of:

::: {.incremental}
- **Theories, ideas, explanations** that frame your thinking
- **Record to check against** for repetition
- **Methods, procedures, data sources** suitable for your problem
- **Conclusions** drawn in related studies
:::

. . .

These become the building blocks for your own research design.

---

## Common Sources of Literature

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Academic Sources:**

- Peer-reviewed journals
- Conference proceedings (CHI, DIS, CSCW for HCI/design)
- Books and book chapters
- Dissertations and theses
- Systematic reviews
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Professional Sources:**

- Industry reports (Nielsen Norman, Forrester)
- White papers
- Design case studies
- Standards documents
- Expert blogs (with caution)
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Key Databases for Design Research
Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, JSTOR, Web of Science
:::

---

## Reading for Relevance: The Process

For each source you find:

**1. RELEVANCE?** Gain general impression

::: {.nonincremental}
- What research question does it address?
- How is it structured?
- Was the problem tackled adequately?
:::

**2. HOW MIGHT IT HELP?** Consider utility

::: {.nonincremental}
- Does it answer part of YOUR question?
- Where are the key findings?
:::

---

## Reading for Relevance (Cont'd)

**3. HOW DOES IT HELP?** Read in depth

::: {.nonincremental}
- How well does it answer your question?
- What are its limitations?
:::

**4. WRITE NOTES**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Citation info (use Zotero, Mendeley)
- Why it's relevant to YOUR work
- Key quotes or findings to reference
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Precaution
Literature review is NOT relisting previous studies. It's **synthesizing** them into YOUR argument.
:::

# Let's Look at Examples {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## Research Paper Examples

As seen on Moodle:

::: {.nonincremental}
1. [Hong Kong Construction Compression](./data/compressing_construction_durations_lessonslearnt_HK.pdf) — quantitative focus
2. [Fashion, Sustainability & Innovation](./data/InnoFashion.pdf) — interview-heavy, qualitative
:::

. . .

**As you skim these, notice:**

::: {.incremental}
- How do they frame what's already known?
- Where do they identify gaps?
- How do they position their contribution?
:::

---

## What is an Annotated Bibliography?

A **bridge** between finding sources and writing the review:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Components:**

- **Citation:** Standard reference
- **Summary:** Main ideas/findings
- **Evaluation:** Strengths & limitations
- **Relevance:** How it informs YOUR topic
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Purpose:**

- Forces you to actually read (not just collect)
- Helps you see patterns across sources
- Becomes raw material for lit review writing
:::
:::

---

## Example Annotation

**Citation:**
Smith, J. (2020). *Designing Trust: UI Elements and User Experience*. Journal of HCI.

**Annotation:**
This study examines how minimalist UI designs impact user trust through A/B testing. It finds that simplified layouts reduce cognitive load and increase user confidence.

- **Strengths:** Robust methodology and clear data analysis.
- **Limitations:** Focuses solely on e-commerce, limiting broader applicability.
- **Relevance:** Offers empirical support for design decisions in UI/UX, aligning with our research question on trust-building features.

# Scavenger Hunt: Your Feature's Literature {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## Your Mission (20 minutes)

**Search for academic/professional sources related to YOUR Instagram feature idea.**

::: {.nonincremental}
**In groups of 3-4:**

1. Define search terms based on your feature (e.g., "social media content curation," "user-generated playlists," "algorithmic transparency")
2. Use Google Scholar, ACM DL, or industry sources
3. Find **3+ diverse sources** (mix of academic and professional)
4. For each: Record title, author, year, source type
5. Note briefly: Why might this be relevant?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Stuck?
Think about the *underlying problem* your feature solves, not the feature itself. What's the user need? The behavior? The frustration?
:::

---

## Search Strategy Tips

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Keyword Strategies:**

- Start broad, then narrow
- Use synonyms (engagement, retention, stickiness)
- Combine terms: "social media" + "user trust"
- Try problem-focused: "doom scrolling" + "design intervention"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Source Strategies:**

- Check "cited by" for newer work
- Check references for foundational work
- Look for survey/review papers (cover lots of ground)
- Search author names who publish in your area
:::
:::

---

## Annotated Bibliography Task

**For your best 2 sources, write a 100-150 word annotation:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Summary:** What does the source say?
- **Evaluation:** How reliable and useful is it?
- **Relevance:** How does it connect to YOUR feature idea?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Payoff
This becomes the start of your Document 0's literature foundation.
:::

# Synthesis: Is Your Gap Still a Gap? {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## The Landscape Check

You've now explored:

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Week 2:** Is the gap real? Does it exist in competitors?
- **Week 3:** What does research say? What's been studied?
:::

. . .

**Reflection questions:**

::: {.incremental}
- Has your understanding of the "gap" changed?
- Did you find research that supports your instinct?
- Did you find something that challenges it?
- Has your feature idea evolved?
:::

---

## The Three Outcomes

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Gap Confirmed ✓

- Neither competitors nor research have addressed this
- You found supporting evidence for the underlying problem
- **Next:** Design your research to fill it
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Gap Refined ↻

- Similar things exist, but with important differences
- Research exists, but not in this context
- **Next:** Sharpen what makes yours unique
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Gap Invalidated ✗

- This already exists or has been studied extensively
- **Next:** Pivot to a new angle, or go deeper than existing work
:::
:::

. . .

**All three outcomes are valuable.** Research isn't about being "right"—it's about knowing the truth.

---

## Wrap-Up: Share & Discuss

**Each group presents:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- One annotated source you found
- How it changed (or confirmed) your thinking about your feature idea
:::

. . .

**Discussion:**

- What surprised you in the literature?
- How does this connect to competitive analysis?
- What next steps would you take?

---

## Key Takeaways

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Competitive analysis** maps the product landscape—what exists, what failed, what's missing
2. **Literature review** maps the knowledge landscape—what's studied, what's theorized, what's unknown
3. **Both serve innovation**—you can't claim "new" without knowing what's old
4. **Your gap evolves**—research refines instinct into insight
5. **This is iterative**—you'll return to the literature throughout your project
:::

## The Journey So Far

- **Week 1:** You had an instinct (feature idea)
- **Week 2:** You learned to validate gaps (is it real?)
- **Week 3:** You mapped the landscape (what exists?)
- **Week 4:** How do you turn this into a **researchable question**?
:::

. . .

Your gap is becoming clearer. Now we need to make it **specific, focused, and answerable**.
