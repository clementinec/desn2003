Whenever I had a question, the AI provided an explanation right away. It felt like having a tutor available 24/7. It saved me so much time because I didn’t have to search for answers on my own. I’m definitely going to keep using such tools for learning."

    "text": "I used an AI chatbot for help in my course, but it wasn’t as great as I expected. Sometimes it gave me answers that were confusing or even wrong. I ended up spending extra time double-checking the information it provided. It was frustrating because I was never sure if I could trust the answers. In the end, I felt like it didn’t improve my learning much, and it might have even hurt my understanding of some topics."

    "text": "I decided not to use any AI or online tutors while studying. I wanted to do everything myself using textbooks and class notes. It was a real challenge and took me a lot longer to get through the material. There were times I got stuck on a concept and had no one to ask for help. I think I learned the material eventually, but I was pretty stressed. After seeing others use AI tools, I’m considering trying it in the future to make studying a bit easier."
