# Three Types of Research: A Framework {background-color="#457B9D"}

## Not All Research Is The Same

Before we dive in, let's establish a framework you'll use all semester:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Discovery Research

**"What's the real problem?"**

- Before any solution exists
- Exploring unknown territory
- Output: Insights, opportunities

*This is where innovation lives*
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Validation Research

**"Does this solution work?"**

- After prototyping
- Testing specific hypotheses
- Output: Go/no-go decisions

*This is iteration territory*
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Innovation Research

**"What doesn't exist yet?"**

- Seeking 10x, not 10%
- Combining insights from multiple domains
- Output: New categories, paradigms

*This is breakthrough territory*
:::
:::

---

## Why This Framework Matters

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Course's Core Question

Can you tell the difference between:

- **Incremental change** (better button color) and
- **Genuine innovation** (new category of interaction)?

Research methodology helps you make this distinction systematically.
:::

. . .

**Today's session is primarily Discovery + Innovation research** — we're mapping what exists so you can see where genuine gaps live.

## Submit Your Document 0 next week!

Length: ≤ 500 words

  - Expand beyond what you've written before
  - Think critically at how much better you could've written this

Style: Extended Abstract

  - Should contain what you normally see in normal abstracts
  - Can contain additional bullet points and outlines on what do you propose to do next or potential outcomes

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Hint
Your Instagram feature idea could be the seed for this—but you'll need to know what's already out there first.
:::

---

## Two Tracks: Choose Your Adventure

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Your Doc 0 Can Take Two Forms

Throughout this course, you can frame your work through **either lens**:

| | **Frontier Research (Technologist)** | **Applied Research (Builder-Maker)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Doc 0** | Extended Abstract | Product Research Brief |
| **Doc 0.1** | Literature Review | Landscape Intelligence Report |
| **Doc 0.2** | Methodology Section | Research Playbook |
| **Doc 1** | Research Paper | Design Case Study |

**Same rigor. Same skills. Different framing.**
:::

. . .

Choose based on your interests: Are you more drawn to being a **technologist/researcher** who shapes the field? Or a **product designer** who ships research-backed features?

---

## Side-by-Side: What Each Track Looks Like

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Frontier Research: Extended Abstract

> *"Social comparison on Instagram has been linked to decreased wellbeing among young adults (Vogel et al., 2014), yet platform-level interventions remain understudied. This research investigates how design friction—specifically, hiding like counts—affects self-reported anxiety in university students aged 18-24. Using a mixed-methods approach combining surveys (n=200) and semi-structured interviews (n=15), we aim to identify whether reduced social comparison metrics correlate with improved mental health outcomes..."*

**Reads like:** Academic paper intro
**Audience:** Researchers, reviewers, professors
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Applied Research: Research Brief

> *"**Problem:** Users report feeling anxious after scrolling Instagram, but engagement metrics show they can't stop. **Opportunity:** Hidden likes (tested in Canada 2019) showed promise but was never fully rolled out. **Research Question:** What happens to user anxiety AND engagement when we hide likes for 2 weeks? **Method:** Diary study + exit interviews with 20 HKU students. **Success metric:** Anxiety decreases without engagement dropping >10%..."*

**Reads like:** Slack message to your PM
**Audience:** Product team, stakeholders, yourself
:::
:::

. . .

**Same research. Same rigor. Different packaging.** Choose yours.

# The Question We Left Open {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## How Thorough Was Your Search?

Last week, you checked if your Instagram feature exists in competitor apps.

. . .

**But did you really know the landscape?**

::: {.incremental}
- Did you check *all* competitors, or just the ones you use?
- Did you find out if Instagram tried this before and killed it?
- Do you know *why* similar features succeeded or failed elsewhere?
- Is there research on this type of feature?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## The Risk
If you don't map what exists, you might "innovate" something that already failed—or reinvent what already works.
:::

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

::: {.r-fit-text}
"I couldn't find anything"

usually means

"I didn't look hard enough"
:::

. . .

Today we fix that.

---

## Today's Goal: Landscape Intelligence

**Landscape Intelligence** = Systematically understanding what exists before you build

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Industry Intelligence
**Competitive Analysis**

- What do competitors offer?
- What's the feature history?
- What do users say about existing solutions?
- What have companies tried and abandoned?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Academic Intelligence
**Literature Review**

- What does research say?
- What theories explain user behavior?
- What methods have been tested?
- What gaps remain unstudied?
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Innovation Test
**Incremental:** "Our button is 10% better than theirs"

**Innovation:** "We found something in the research that no product has applied yet"

Landscape intelligence helps you tell the difference.
:::

# Part 1: Competitive Analysis {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## What Is Competitive Analysis?

A systematic examination of similar products/features to understand:

::: {.incremental}
- **What exists:** Features, approaches, solutions already in market
- **What works:** Successful implementations and why
- **What failed:** Abandoned features, pivots, user backlash
- **What's missing:** Gaps that remain unfilled
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## For Your Instagram Feature
Before proposing a "new" feature, you need to know: Has this been tried? Does it exist elsewhere? Why or why not?
:::

---

## The Competitive Landscape for Social Media

**Direct Competitors:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- TikTok, Snapchat, BeReal, YouTube Shorts, X/Twitter, Threads, WeChat, LINE
:::

**Adjacent Products:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Pinterest (visual discovery), Discord (community), WhatsApp (messaging), Notion (sharing)
:::

**Historical Context:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Vine (dead), Google+ (dead), Clubhouse (declined), Periscope (absorbed)
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## The Graveyard Matters
Failed products and killed features tell you what *didn't* work—often more valuable than successes.
:::

---

## Sources for Landscape Intelligence

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Product Intelligence:**

- App Store / Play Store (features, reviews, update history)
- Product Hunt (launch announcements)
- TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired (feature coverage)
- Company blogs and newsrooms
- Wayback Machine (historical snapshots)
- **Patent searches** (Google Patents — see what's being protected)
- **Industry reports** (Forrester, Nielsen Norman, Gartner)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**User Sentiment Intelligence:**

- App reviews (**1-star reviews are gold** — real pain points)
- Reddit communities (r/Instagram, r/socialmedia, r/UXDesign)
- Twitter/X complaints and wishlists
- YouTube reviews and comparisons
- Designer/developer forums (Hacker News, Designer News)
- **Discord servers** (product-specific communities)
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Pro Tip
Search "[feature name] + failed" or "[app name] + removed feature" to find the graveyard. The graveyard tells you what **didn't** work — often more valuable than successes.

# 5-Minute Research Wins {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## Research Doesn't Have to Take Forever

Before you spend weeks on a literature review, try these **5-minute techniques** that can redirect your entire project:

---

## 5-Min Win #1: Reddit Sentiment Mining

**The technique:** Search `[your topic] site:reddit.com` on Google

**Example:** `"Instagram anxiety" site:reddit.com`

**What you'll find in 5 minutes:**

- r/socialanxiety: *"I deleted Instagram for 2 weeks and my anxiety dropped immediately"* (4.2k upvotes)
- r/instagram: *"The new 'take a break' feature is useless, I just click through it"* (890 upvotes)
- r/UXDesign: *"We tested hiding likes internally and engagement dropped 23%"*

**Credibility check:** Reddit is anecdotal, not research. But 4.2k upvotes = signal worth investigating. Use this to *generate* hypotheses, not *prove* them.

---

## 5-Min Win #2: App Store Review Mining

**The technique:** Go to App Store → Read 1-star reviews → Search for patterns

**Example:** Instagram 1-star reviews, filtered to "Recent"

**What you'll find in 5 minutes:**

- *"Algorithm shows me content that makes me feel bad about myself"* (repeated 50+ times)
- *"Why can't I see posts in chronological order anymore"* (repeated 100+ times)
- *"Reels are taking over my feed and I hate it"* (repeated 200+ times)

**Credibility check:** These are real users with real frustrations. Apple verifies purchases. This is primary data.

---

## 5-Min Win #3: Google Trends Validation

**The technique:** [trends.google.com](https://trends.google.com) → Compare search terms

**Example:** Compare "Instagram anxiety" vs "TikTok anxiety" vs "social media detox"

**What you'll learn in 5 minutes:**

- "Social media detox" searches spike every January (New Year's resolutions)
- "Instagram anxiety" has grown 300% since 2019
- Regional differences: Higher in US/UK than Asia

**Credibility check:** This is behavioral data (what people actually search), not self-report. More reliable than surveys for some questions.

---

## 5-Min Win #4: Wayback Machine Autopsy

**The technique:** [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) → Enter competitor URL → See historical snapshots

**Example:** Look at Instagram.com in 2015 vs 2020 vs today

**What you'll learn in 5 minutes:**

- Features that existed and disappeared (chronological feed toggle)
- UI patterns that were tested and abandoned
- The exact moment they pivoted to Reels-first

**Credibility check:** This is primary historical evidence. Screenshots don't lie.

---

## The 5-Minute Stack

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Before You Write Anything, Spend 20 Minutes:

| 5 min | Reddit sentiment mining | → Real user language, pain points |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 5 min | App Store 1-star reviews | → Verified user frustrations |
| 5 min | Google Trends | → Is this problem growing or shrinking? |
| 5 min | Wayback Machine | → Has this been tried before? |

**Total: 20 minutes. Outcome: You either validate your direction or pivot before wasting weeks.**
:::

This is what product researchers at real companies do first. Now you know too.

## The Research That Shipped: Airbnb's Photography

**Let's reverse-engineer what landscape intelligence they missed — and then found.**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What They Missed Initially (2009):**

- Beautiful website, zero bookings
- They built the product, not the intelligence
- **No competitive analysis** of why Craigslist listings (their competition) looked terrible
- **No user research** on what actually blocked booking decisions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**What Landscape Intelligence Would Have Revealed:**

- Academic research on e-commerce photography existed
- Competitor analysis: every listing had bad photos
- User sentiment: "I can't tell what I'm booking"
- **The gap was obvious — if they'd looked**
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Lesson
They spent months building the wrong thing. One weekend of landscape intelligence would have saved them.
:::

---

## Screenshot This

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The best founders**

**read the research**

**that their competitors ignore.**
:::

. . .

Airbnb's competitors had MBAs. Airbnb had ethnography.

---

## Competitive Analysis Framework

For each competitor/feature, document:

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| **What is it?** | Feature name, how it works, when launched |
| **Who uses it?** | Target users, use cases |
| **How well does it work?** | User reception, ratings, complaints |
| **What's the trajectory?** | Growing? Stagnant? Killed? |
| **Why does it matter for your idea?** | Validates gap? Invalidates it? Inspires iteration? |

. . .

This becomes your **competitive landscape map**—the foundation for knowing if your gap is real.

## Debrief: What Did the Landscape Reveal?

::: {.incremental}
- Did anyone discover their feature already exists?
- Did anyone find a failed attempt at something similar?
- Did anyone's gap get *stronger* after seeing what competitors lack?
- What surprised you?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Insight
Competitive analysis doesn't kill ideas—it **refines** them. Now you know what to differentiate from.
:::

# Part 2: From Industry to Academy {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Competitive Analysis Is Not Enough

You've mapped the product landscape. But there's more:

::: {.incremental}
- **Why** do certain features succeed psychologically?
- **What theories** explain user behavior in this space?
- **What research methods** have been used to study this?
- **What do experts know** that practitioners haven't applied yet?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Gap Between Industry and Academy
Companies move fast and often don't read research. Academics study deeply but publish slowly. **Your advantage:** You can bridge both.
:::

---

## Literature Review: Stealing From the Smartest People

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Reframe: Why Read Papers?

**Old framing:** "Academic requirement"

**New framing:** "Smartest people in the world spent years thinking about your problem. You can steal their insights in an afternoon."
:::

. . .

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Literature =
The body of knowledge in any discipline:

- Theoretical frameworks
- Empirical studies
- Practical applications
- Relevant investigations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Review =
Knowledge organized to show:

- What's known
- What's debated
- What's missing
- Why YOUR work adds value
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## The Technologist Advantage
With GenAI tools (Semantic Scholar, Elicit, Connected Papers), you can now survey a field's knowledge in hours, not months. **Research is democratized.** The question is: will you use it?
:::

---

## GenAI Research Toolkit: Copy-Paste Prompts

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Prompt 1: Literature Survey (use with Claude, ChatGPT, or Perplexity)

```
I'm researching [YOUR TOPIC, e.g., "how hiding social media metrics
affects user anxiety"].

Give me:
1. The 5 most-cited academic papers on this topic (with real citations
   I can verify on Google Scholar)
2. Key findings from each
3. What methodology each used
4. What gap remains unstudied

Be specific. If you're uncertain about a citation, say so.
```
:::

**Credibility check:** Always verify citations exist on Google Scholar. LLMs hallucinate papers. Trust but verify.

---

## GenAI Toolkit (Continued)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Prompt 2: Competitive Landscape (use with Perplexity for web access)

```
I'm designing a feature for [APP] that [DOES X].

Research and tell me:
1. Which competitor apps have tried something similar?
2. What happened? (Still live? Killed? Pivoted?)
3. What do users say about these features in reviews/Reddit?
4. Link me to sources so I can verify.
```
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Prompt 3: Gap Validation

```
I believe there's a gap: [YOUR GAP STATEMENT].

Challenge this. Tell me:
1. Has this actually been studied? Find counter-evidence.
2. Has a product tried this and failed?
3. What's the strongest argument AGAINST this being a real gap?
```
:::

**Why Prompt 3 matters:** You want the AI to argue against you. Confirmation bias is your enemy.

---

## Why Literature Review Matters

::: {.incremental}
- **Understand the research landscape**—what's been studied, what hasn't
- **Avoid repetitive work**—don't "discover" what's already known
- **Build on existing theory**—your work stands on others' shoulders
- **Identify research gaps**—where can YOU contribute?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Connection to Your Feature Idea
Maybe your feature addresses a gap that researchers have *already identified* but industry hasn't solved yet. Literature review helps you find that.
:::

---

## Two Phases of Literature Review

**Phase One: Catch-them-all**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Identify all relevant publications within your problem space
- Read/skim through and broaden your understanding
- Critique how/why some are (not) adequate in what they claim
:::

. . .

**Phase Two: Write on Relevance**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Synthesize findings into coherent writing
- Present **your own evaluation**—both strengths and weaknesses
- Create a roadmap showing how your work fits in
:::

---

## What Literature Review Provides

A stock of:

::: {.incremental}
- **Theories, ideas, explanations** that frame your thinking
- **Record to check against** for repetition
- **Methods, procedures, data sources** suitable for your problem
- **Conclusions** drawn in related studies
:::

. . .

These become the building blocks for your own research design.

---

## Common Sources of Literature

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Academic Sources:**

- Peer-reviewed journals
- Conference proceedings (CHI, DIS, CSCW for HCI/design)
- Books and book chapters
- Dissertations and theses
- Systematic reviews
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Professional Sources:**

- Industry reports (Nielsen Norman, Forrester)
- White papers
- Design case studies
- Standards documents
- Expert blogs (with caution)
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Key Databases for Design Research
Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, JSTOR, Web of Science

**AI-Powered Tools:** Semantic Scholar, Elicit, Connected Papers, Research Rabbit — these help you find connections you'd miss manually.
:::

---

## Anti-Patterns: How Landscape Intelligence Goes Wrong

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Competitive Analysis Anti-Patterns

- **Only checking direct competitors** — adjacent products matter too
- **Ignoring the graveyard** — dead products teach more than living ones
- **Surface-level feature lists** — you need to understand *why* features exist
- **Recency bias** — "It doesn't exist" vs. "It existed and was killed"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Literature Review Anti-Patterns

- **Summarizing without synthesizing** — a list isn't a review
- **Cherry-picking** — only citing papers that support your view
- **Ignoring methodology** — if a study has 5 participants, that matters
- **Assuming "no papers" = "gap"** — maybe you searched wrong
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## The Worst Anti-Pattern
**"I couldn't find anything, so it must be a gap."**

Before claiming a gap, ask: Did I search with the right terms? In the right databases? Did I check adjacent fields?
:::

---

## Anti-Pattern Autopsy: Real Examples

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Bad: Surface-Level Competitive Analysis

*"TikTok has short videos. Instagram has Reels. YouTube has Shorts. They're all the same."*

**What's wrong:** Misses that TikTok's algorithm, creator incentives, and content culture are fundamentally different. Reels copied the format, not the innovation.

**Credibility check:** Can you explain *why* TikTok succeeded where Vine failed? If not, you haven't gone deep enough.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Bad: Citation Without Synthesis

*"Smith (2019) studied social media anxiety. Jones (2020) also studied social media anxiety. Lee (2021) found similar results."*

**What's wrong:** This is a list, not a synthesis. What do these papers *together* tell us? Where do they disagree? What's the gap between them?

**Credibility check:** After reading your lit review, can someone understand the *state of the field* — not just which papers exist?
:::
:::

---

## Anti-Pattern Autopsy: The Methodology Trap

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## This Paper Sounds Impressive, But...

*"Our study found that 90% of users prefer the new design."*

**Red flags to check:**

- **Sample size:** n=10 users (your friend group isn't research)
- **Selection bias:** "Users who opted into our beta" (already favorable)
- **Measurement:** "Prefer" = asked directly, not observed behavior
- **Generalization:** Study done in Sweden, you're designing for HK

**Your job:** Don't just cite papers. **Evaluate** them.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Credibility Checklist for Any Source

1. **Who:** Peer-reviewed? Industry report? Random blog?
2. **When:** Is 2015 data still relevant for 2026 TikTok behavior?
3. **How many:** n=500 is different from n=12
4. **Where:** Western samples may not apply to Asian contexts
5. **How:** Survey ≠ behavior. What people say ≠ what they do.
:::

---

## Reading for Relevance: The Process

For each source you find:

**1. RELEVANCE?** Gain general impression

::: {.nonincremental}
- What research question does it address?
- How is it structured?
- Was the problem tackled adequately?
:::

**2. HOW MIGHT IT HELP?** Consider utility

::: {.nonincremental}
- Does it answer part of YOUR question?
- Where are the key findings?
:::

---

## Reading for Relevance (Cont'd)

**3. HOW DOES IT HELP?** Read in depth

::: {.nonincremental}
- How well does it answer your question?
- What are its limitations?
:::

**4. WRITE NOTES**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Citation info (use Zotero, Mendeley)
- Why it's relevant to YOUR work
- Key quotes or findings to reference
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Precaution
Literature review is NOT relisting previous studies. It's **synthesizing** them into YOUR argument.
:::

# Let's Look at Examples {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## Research Paper Examples

::: {.nonincremental}
1. [Compressing Construction Durations: Lessons from Hong Kong](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263786300000326) — quantitative regression model, industry surveys
2. [Can Fashion Be Sustainable? Trajectories of Change](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15487733.2024.2312682) — qualitative framework, organizational + socio-cultural analysis (open access)
:::

. . .

**As you skim these, notice:**

::: {.incremental}
- How do they frame what's already known?
- Where do they identify gaps?
- How do they position their contribution?
:::

---

## What is an Annotated Bibliography?

A **bridge** between finding sources and writing the review:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Components:**

- **Citation:** Standard reference
- **Summary:** Main ideas/findings
- **Evaluation:** Strengths & limitations
- **Relevance:** How it informs YOUR topic
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Purpose:**

- Forces you to actually read (not just collect)
- Helps you see patterns across sources
- Becomes raw material for lit review writing
:::
:::

---

## Example Annotation: Bad vs Good

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Bad Annotation

**Citation:** Smith, J. (2020). *Designing Trust*. Journal of HCI.

*"This paper is about trust in UI design. It found that simple designs are better. This is relevant to my research because I'm also studying design."*

**What's wrong:**

- No specific findings
- No methodology mentioned
- "Relevant because I'm studying design" — meaningless
- Could be written without reading the paper
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Good Annotation

**Citation:** Smith, J. (2020). *Designing Trust: UI Elements and User Experience*. Journal of HCI.

*"A/B test (n=2,400) comparing minimalist vs. feature-rich checkout UIs. Found 23% higher completion rates for minimalist design, attributed to reduced cognitive load (measured via eye-tracking). **Limitation:** E-commerce only, Western sample. **Gap:** Doesn't address social media contexts. **For my research:** Provides methodology template for measuring trust via completion behaviors, but I'll need to adapt for Instagram context."*

**What's right:**

- Specific numbers
- Method identified
- Limitations acknowledged
- Clear connection to YOUR work
:::
:::

. . .

**Credibility check:** Could you write this annotation without reading the paper? If yes, it's too vague.

# Scavenger Hunt: Your Feature's Literature {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## Your Mission (20 minutes)

**Search for academic/professional sources related to YOUR Instagram feature idea.**

::: {.nonincremental}
**In groups of 3-4:**

1. Define search terms based on your feature (e.g., "social media content curation," "user-generated playlists," "algorithmic transparency")
2. Use Google Scholar, ACM DL, or industry sources
3. Find **3+ diverse sources** (mix of academic and professional)
4. For each: Record title, author, year, source type
5. Note briefly: Why might this be relevant?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Stuck?
Think about the *underlying problem* your feature solves, not the feature itself. What's the user need? The behavior? The frustration?
:::

---

## Search Strategy Tips

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Keyword Strategies:**

- Start broad, then narrow
- Use synonyms (engagement, retention, stickiness)
- Combine terms: "social media" + "user trust"
- Try problem-focused: "doom scrolling" + "design intervention"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Source Strategies:**

- Check "cited by" for newer work
- Check references for foundational work
- Look for survey/review papers (cover lots of ground)
- Search author names who publish in your area
:::
:::

---

## Annotated Bibliography Task

**For your best 2 sources, write a 100-150 word annotation:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Summary:** What does the source say?
- **Evaluation:** How reliable and useful is it?
- **Relevance:** How does it connect to YOUR feature idea?
:::

. . .

# Synthesis: Is Your Gap Still a Gap? {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## The Landscape Check

You've now explored:

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Week 2:** Is the gap real? Does it exist in competitors?
- **Week 3:** What does research say? What's been studied?
:::

. . .

**Reflection questions:**

::: {.incremental}
- Has your understanding of the "gap" changed?
- Did you find research that supports your instinct?
- Did you find something that challenges it?
- Has your feature idea evolved?
:::

## The Three Outcomes

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Gap Confirmed ✓

- Neither competitors nor research have addressed this
- You found supporting evidence for the underlying problem
- **Next:** Design your research to fill it
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Gap Refined ↻

- Similar things exist, but with important differences
- Research exists, but not in this context
- **Next:** Sharpen what makes yours unique
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Gap Invalidated ✗

- This already exists or has been studied extensively
- **Next:** Pivot to a new angle, or go deeper than existing work
:::
:::

. . .

**All three outcomes are valuable.** Research isn't about being "right"—it's about knowing the truth.

## The Innovation Spectrum: Where Does Your Gap Land?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Rate Your Gap

After your landscape intelligence, ask yourself:

| Score | Description | What It Means |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **1** | "This exists everywhere" | No gap — iteration only |
| **2** | "This exists, but poorly executed" | Incremental improvement opportunity |
| **3** | "This exists in one domain, not mine" | Transfer innovation opportunity |
| **4** | "Research describes this, no product applies it" | **Applied innovation opportunity** |
| **5** | "Neither research nor products address this" | **Discovery research territory** |
:::

. . .

**Scores 4-5 are where genuine innovation lives.** Scores 1-2 are optimization. Both are valid — but know which you're doing.

## The Question That Changes Everything

::: {.r-fit-text}
**"Has anyone smart**

**already thought about this?"**
:::

. . .

If yes → steal their insights.

If no → you might be onto something. Or you searched wrong. Check again.

## Wrap-Up: Share & Discuss

**Each group presents:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- One annotated source you found
- How it changed (or confirmed) your thinking about your feature idea
:::

. . .

**Discussion:**

- What surprised you in the literature?
- How does this connect to competitive analysis?
- What next steps would you take?

---

## Key Takeaways

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Landscape Intelligence** = Competitive analysis + Literature review — both are required
2. **Three research types:** Discovery (what's the problem?), Validation (does this work?), Innovation (what doesn't exist?)
3. **Literature is leverage** — steal insights from people who spent years on your problem
4. **Anti-patterns are everywhere** — summarizing isn't synthesizing, direct competitors aren't the only competitors
5. **The innovation spectrum** — know whether you're doing incremental improvement (fine!) or genuine innovation (different approach)
6. **GenAI democratizes research** — you can now survey a field in hours. Will you?

## Next Week: Research Questions

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Journey So Far

- **Week 1:** You had an instinct (feature idea)
- **Week 2:** You learned to validate gaps (is it real?)
- **Week 3:** You mapped the landscape (what exists?)
- **Week 4:** How do you turn this into a **researchable question**?
:::

. . .

Your gap is becoming clearer. Now we need to make it **specific, focused, and answerable**.

## Reminder: Document 0 Due Next Week

::: {.nonincremental}
- ≤ 500 words (Extended Abstract OR Product Research Brief — your choice)
- Include: Problem, gap, proposed approach, potential outcomes
- Use what you learned today to ground it in the landscape
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Pro Tip
Reference at least 2-3 sources from your canvas. Show you've done the landscape work.

**Even better:** Include one insight from the 5-minute stack (Reddit, App Store, Trends) — shows you're doing real-world intelligence, not just academic citation.
