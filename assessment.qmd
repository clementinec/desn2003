## Before You Begin

You might feel like you don't know enough to do research. That's normal — and it's also backwards.

Research isn't a demonstration of what you already know. It's the practice of *building* knowledge in directions you're curious about. You start from where you are, not from where you think you should be. The whole point is to end up somewhere new.

Every researcher — including your instructors, including published scholars — began by not knowing. The difference isn't innate ability; it's the willingness to sit with uncertainty and work through it systematically. That's what this course teaches.

::: {.callout-tip}
## You are building your own curriculum
Research is one of the few spaces where you set the agenda. You choose the question. You decide what matters. You develop expertise in a direction *you* find meaningful — not one handed to you. That's uncomfortable at first, but it's also where the real learning happens.
:::

Don't wait until you feel "ready." You become ready by doing the work.

If you hit a wall — you know *what* you want to investigate but not *how* to get there — that's exactly what office hours are for. Bring your confusion. Bring your half-formed ideas. That's not a sign of failure; it's the normal state of research in progress. AI tools can help too, but sometimes a conversation cuts through faster.

---

## Choosing Your Topic

::: {.callout-note}
## This is your research.
You have full agency in selecting a topic that genuinely interests you. The best research comes from authentic curiosity — not from trying to guess what the instructor wants.
:::

Follow your curiosity. What problems, questions, or phenomena do you find yourself thinking about? What would you want to understand better even if it weren't for a grade?

Your topic should be **narrow enough** to investigate meaningfully in one semester, but **broad enough** to find existing literature and evidence. It should connect to design, innovation, or the built environment — though this can be interpreted broadly.

Embrace uncertainty. You don't need all the answers at the start. Research is a process of discovery, and your understanding will evolve. There is no "correct" topic. What matters is how rigorously you investigate it.

---

## Document Progression

Your individual research develops through four sequential documents, each worth **10%** of your final grade. Think of these as checkpoints in a larger journey — each one builds on what came before.

```

### Document 0: Extended Abstract

Your initial research scope and direction. This is where you stake out your territory — articulating the problem you want to investigate and why it matters.

Write clearly and concisely (≤500 words). State the problem, explain its significance (both personally and broadly), and sketch your initial approach. If relevant, connect to sustainability or design implications.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Common pitfalls
Abstracts should be **plain text** — no citations. Avoid being too broad ("I want to study sustainability") or too narrow to find literature. Don't just describe *what* you'll study; explain *why it matters*.
:::

**Success looks like:** A clearly articulated, appropriately scoped problem. Genuine engagement with the topic. Logical connection between the problem and its significance.

---

### Document 0.1: Literature Review

A synthesis of existing research relevant to your topic. This is not a list of summaries — it's an argument about the state of knowledge in your area.

Identify key sources (academic papers, books, reports). Summarize and critically evaluate each. Then synthesize: How do these sources relate to each other? Where do they agree or disagree? What patterns emerge? Most importantly — what's missing? The gap you identify may be where your research contributes.

::: {.callout-tip}
## What makes a strong literature review
Organization matters. Structure your review thematically, chronologically, or methodologically — not just source-by-source. Show that you understand the landscape, not just individual papers.
:::

**Success looks like:** Relevant, credible, diverse sources. Demonstration of understanding, not just summary. Clear organizational logic. Identification of gaps. Proper citations.

---

### Document 0.2: Collecting Evidence

Your plan for gathering and analyzing data. Here you move from "what others have said" to "what I will find out."

Describe your methodology — qualitative, quantitative, or mixed. Specify your methods: interviews, surveys, observations, archival research, experiments. Justify why these methods suit your research question. If you have preliminary data or pilot results, include them.

Be honest about limitations. Every method has trade-offs. Acknowledging them shows sophistication, not weakness.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Common pitfalls
Don't choose methods because they're easy — choose them because they're appropriate. Vague analysis plans ("I will analyze the data") don't demonstrate understanding. Address ethical considerations where relevant.
:::

**Success looks like:** Methods appropriate for the question. Clear understanding of strengths and limitations. Concrete plan for collection and analysis. Honest engagement with potential biases.

---

### Document 1: Research Paper Draft

A near-complete research paper integrating all previous work. This is the culmination of your semester-long investigation.

Your paper should have a clear narrative arc: Introduction → Literature Review → Methodology → Findings → Discussion → Conclusion. Each section should build on and connect to the others. Include personal reflection on what you learned through the process.

> **The goal is not to have all the answers.** Research often raises more questions than it answers. What matters is the rigor of your thinking and the honesty of your engagement with complexity.

**Success looks like:** Clear narrative from question to conclusion. Strong integration of literature, methods, and findings. Quality writing and presentation. Thoughtful reflection on limitations and lessons learned.

---

## Professional Discovery (30%)

*Previously called "Group/Interview Project" or "Informational Interviews" — same thing, better name.*

In addition to individual research, you will conduct **conversations with practitioners** — designers, project managers, and other professionals working in areas relevant to your interests. This is research in action: reaching out to real people with real expertise, learning how the field actually works.

```{=html}
<div class="two-col">
  <div class="info-block">
    <h3>In-Class Presentation (15%)</h3>
    <p>Present your findings to the class. Demonstrate techniques learned throughout the semester — critical thinking, storytelling, clear communication of insights.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
    <h3>Documentation (15%)</h3>
    <p>Showcase your process and findings. Include interview materials and synthesize insights across conversations.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Keep it clear, not long
Neither component requires extensive writing. Focus on **clear organization** and **clarity in reporting** — not word count. A well-structured slide deck or a concise document with strong visuals often works better than pages of prose.
:::

This can be done individually or in groups. Groups allow you to reach more people and expand your professional network, but require coordination and shared accountability.

::: {.callout-note}
## Recognize your positionality
You bring biases and assumptions to every interview. That's not a flaw — it's human. The goal is to recognize and account for your positionality, not pretend it doesn't exist.
:::

---

## Peer Evaluation (20%)

At the end of the semester, you will present your **Individual Research** to the class. Your peers will evaluate these presentations — and you will evaluate theirs. This component accounts for **20%** of your grade.

This serves two purposes. First, you learn from exposure to diverse research topics and approaches. Second, you develop critical judgment — the ability to evaluate research quality, which is itself a core research skill.

Your evaluations should be **constructive**, **specific**, and **fair**. Saying "this was good" or "this was confusing" isn't helpful. Explain *what* worked and *why*, or *what* was unclear and *how* it might be improved.

---

## Class Participation (10%)

**10%** of your grade reflects your presence and engagement.

Research is collaborative. Your contributions to class discussions, activities, and critiques benefit everyone — including yourself. Showing up matters. Engaging matters more.

## Submission Guidelines

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Deadline** | EOD Wednesday before the relevant class |
| **Format** | Submit via Moodle/Turnitin |

### On Using AI

AI tools are **not prohibited** — in fact, they're welcome. Use them to enhance the quality of your writing, clarify your thinking, or get unstuck.

That said: if your submission reads like AI output without evident critical thinking — generic structure, surface-level analysis, no personal engagement with the material — the instructor may reach out to check whether you need additional support.

The goal is for AI to help *you* write better, not to write *for* you. You should be able to explain and stand behind everything in your submission — that's how you know it's still yours.

### Late Policy

::: {.callout-tip}
## One free extension — no questions asked
Life happens. Every student gets **one 7-day extension** to use during the semester. No documentation required, no explanation needed. Just let the instructor know before the original deadline. Use it wisely.
:::

**Just missed the deadline?** If your submission is late but within **1 hour** of the deadline, you may submit via Slack with a timestamp as proof. This receipt allows you to work with the instructor to update your Moodle record. Beyond 1 hour, standard late penalties apply.

**Late penalties:** Every **48 hours late** = one sub-letter grade deduction (e.g., A → A-, then A- → B+, and so on). Exceptions beyond your free extension require a valid doctor's note or equivalent documentation.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Confirm your submission record
Your Moodle submission record must accurately reflect your work **by the last day of teaching**. Double-check that files are uploaded correctly and receipts are confirmed. Anything missing or incorrectly uploaded by that date will be treated as a non-submission — there won't be an opportunity to fix it after the fact.
:::

---

## A Note on Grades

::: {.callout-important}
## Grades reflect process, not "correctness"
Research rarely produces definitive answers. Grades reflect the quality of your inquiry — not whether you arrived at a predetermined conclusion.
:::

**High grades** go to work that demonstrates genuine intellectual engagement, rigorous and appropriate methods, clear writing, honest acknowledgment of limitations, and evidence of growth over the semester.

**The goal is not perfection.** The goal is to develop as a researcher — to learn how to ask good questions, find and evaluate evidence, and communicate your thinking clearly.

If you engage seriously with that process, the grades will follow.
