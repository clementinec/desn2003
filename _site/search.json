    "text": "Before You Begin\nYou might feel like you don’t know enough to do research. That’s normal — and it’s also backwards.\nResearch isn’t a demonstration of what you already know. It’s the practice of building knowledge in directions you’re curious about. You start from where you are, not from where you think you should be. The whole point is to end up somewhere new.\nEvery researcher — including your instructors, including published scholars — began by not knowing. The difference isn’t innate ability; it’s the willingness to sit with uncertainty and work through it systematically. That’s what this course teaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are building your own curriculum\n\n\n\nResearch is one of the few spaces where you set the agenda. You choose the question. You decide what matters. You develop expertise in a direction you find meaningful — not one handed to you. That’s uncomfortable at first, but it’s also where the real learning happens.\n\n\nDon’t wait until you feel “ready.” You become ready by doing the work.\nIf you hit a wall — you know what you want to investigate but not how to get there — that’s exactly what office hours are for. Bring your confusion. Bring your half-formed ideas. That’s not a sign of failure; it’s the normal state of research in progress. AI tools can help too, but sometimes a conversation cuts through faster."

The best research comes from authentic curiosity — not from trying to guess what the instructor wants.\n\n\nFollow your curiosity. What problems, questions, or phenomena do you find yourself thinking about? What would you want to understand better even if it weren’t for a grade?\nYour topic should be narrow enough to investigate meaningfully in one semester, but broad enough to find existing literature and evidence. It should connect to design, innovation, or the built environment — though this can be interpreted broadly.\nEmbrace uncertainty. You don’t need all the answers at the start. Research is a process of discovery, and your understanding will evolve. There is no “correct” topic. What matters is how rigorously you investigate it."

Think of these as checkpoints in a larger journey — each one builds on what came before.\n\n  \n    Doc 0\n    Extended Abstract\n  \n  →\n  \n    Doc 0.1\n    Literature Review\n  \n  →\n  \n    Doc 0.2\n    Collecting Evidence\n  \n  →\n  \n    Doc 1\n    Research Paper\n  \n\n\n\nDocument 0: Extended Abstract\nYour initial research scope and direction. This is where you stake out your territory — articulating the problem you want to investigate and why it matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Stakes out a knowledge gap — what don’t we know yet that matters to your field?\nApplied Research: Stakes out a design opportunity — what problem is worth solving, and why now?\n\n\nWrite clearly and concisely (≤500 words). State the problem, explain its significance (both personally and broadly), and sketch your initial approach. If relevant, connect to sustainability or design implications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon pitfalls\n\n\n\nAbstracts should be plain text — no citations. Avoid being too broad (“I want to study sustainability”) or too narrow to find literature. Don’t just describe what you’ll study; explain why it matters.\n\n\nSuccess looks like: A clearly articulated, appropriately scoped problem. Genuine engagement with the topic. Logical connection between the problem and its significance.\n\n\n\nDocument 0.1: Literature Review\nA synthesis of existing research relevant to your topic. This is not a list of summaries — it’s an argument about the state of knowledge in your area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Surveys the scholarly conversation. Where does your question fit in the existing literature? What have others found?\nApplied Research: Surveys both research and market landscape. What exists (products, studies, precedents)? What’s missing or underserved?\n\n\nIdentify key sources (academic papers, books, reports). Summarize and critically evaluate each. Then synthesize: How do these sources relate to each other? Where do they agree or disagree? What patterns emerge? Most importantly — what’s missing? The gap you identify may be where your research contributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes a strong literature review\n\n\n\nOrganization matters. Structure your review thematically, chronologically, or methodologically — not just source-by-source. Show that you understand the landscape, not just individual papers.\n\n\nSuccess looks like: Relevant, credible, diverse sources. Demonstration of understanding, not just summary. Clear organizational logic. Identification of gaps. Proper citations.\n\n\n\nDocument 0.2: Collecting Evidence\nYour plan for gathering and analyzing data. Here you move from “what others have said” to “what I will find out.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Primary data to test a hypothesis or answer a research question. Methods should align with your field’s standards.\nApplied Research: Primary data to validate assumptions and inform design decisions. Focus on methods that reduce risk before building.\n\n\nDescribe your methodology — qualitative, quantitative, or mixed. Specify your methods: interviews, surveys, observations, archival research, experiments. Justify why these methods suit your research question. If you have preliminary data or pilot results, include them.\nBe honest about limitations. Every method has trade-offs. Acknowledging them shows sophistication, not weakness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon pitfalls\n\n\n\nDon’t choose methods because they’re easy — choose them because they’re appropriate. Vague analysis plans (“I will analyze the data”) don’t demonstrate understanding. Address ethical considerations where relevant.\n\n\nSuccess looks like: Methods appropriate for the question. Clear understanding of strengths and limitations. Concrete plan for collection and analysis. Honest engagement with potential biases.\n\n\n\nDocument 1: Research Paper Draft\nA near-complete research paper integrating all previous work. This is the culmination of your semester-long investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Contributes new knowledge to a field — structured like a conference paper or journal article with clear academic contribution.\nApplied Research: Makes a case for a design direction — a design case study that shows how evidence informed your recommendation.\n\n\nYour paper should have a clear narrative arc: Introduction → Literature Review → Methodology → Findings → Discussion → Conclusion. Each section should build on and connect to the others. Include personal reflection on what you learned through the process.\n\nThe goal is not to have all the answers. Research often raises more questions than it answers. What matters is the rigor of your thinking and the honesty of your engagement with complexity.\n\nSuccess looks like: Clear narrative from question to conclusion. Strong integration of literature, methods, and findings. Quality writing and presentation. Thoughtful reflection on limitations and lessons learned."

This is research in action: reaching out to real people with real expertise, learning how the field actually works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentations: Weeks 8 & 9\n\n\n\nWe dedicate class time in both Week 8 (Mar 17) and Week 9 (Mar 24) for Professional Discovery presentations. This gives every group adequate time to present without rushing. Documentation is due Week 10.\n\n\n\n  \n    In-Class Presentation (15%)\n    Present your findings to the class. Demonstrate techniques learned throughout the semester — critical thinking, storytelling, clear communication of insights.\n  \n  \n    Documentation (15%)\n    Showcase your process and findings. Include interview materials and synthesize insights across conversations.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep it clear, not long\n\n\n\nNeither component requires extensive writing. Focus on clear organization and clarity in reporting — not word count. A well-structured slide deck or a concise document with strong visuals often works better than pages of prose.\n\n\nThis can be done individually or in groups. Groups allow you to reach more people and expand your professional network, but require coordination and shared accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognize your positionality\n\n\n\nYou bring biases and assumptions to every interview. That’s not a flaw — it’s human. The goal is to recognize and account for your positionality, not pretend it doesn’t exist."

This component accounts for 20% of your grade.\nThis serves two purposes. First, you learn from exposure to diverse research topics and approaches. Second, you develop critical judgment — the ability to evaluate research quality, which is itself a core research skill.\nYour evaluations should be constructive, specific, and fair. Saying “this was good” or “this was confusing” isn’t helpful. Explain what worked and why, or what was unclear and how it might be improved."

This gives you the evening before to finalize, not scramble at 11:59 PM. Plan accordingly.\n\n\n\nOn Using AI\nAI tools are not prohibited — in fact, they’re welcome. Use them to enhance the quality of your writing, clarify your thinking, or get unstuck.\nThat said: if your submission reads like AI output without evident critical thinking — generic structure, surface-level analysis, no personal engagement with the material — the instructor may reach out to check whether you need additional support.\nThe goal is for AI to help you write better, not to write for you. You should be able to explain and stand behind everything in your submission — that’s how you know it’s still yours.\n\n\nLate Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne free extension — no questions asked\n\n\n\nLife happens. Every student gets one 7-day extension to use during the semester. No documentation required, no explanation needed. Just let the instructor know before the original deadline. Use it wisely.\n\n\nJust missed the deadline? If your submission is late but within 1 hour of the noon deadline, you may submit via Slack with a timestamp as proof. This receipt allows you to work with the instructor to update your Moodle record. Beyond 1 hour (i.e., after 1:00 PM), standard late penalties apply.\nLate penalties: Every 48 hours late = one sub-letter grade deduction (e.g., A → A-, then A- → B+, and so on). Exceptions beyond your free extension require a valid doctor’s note or equivalent documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfirm your submission record\n\n\n\nYour Moodle submission record must accurately reflect your work by the last day of teaching. Double-check that files are uploaded correctly and receipts are confirmed. Anything missing or incorrectly uploaded by that date will be treated as a non-submission — there won’t be an opportunity to fix it after the fact."

The goal is to develop as a researcher — to learn how to ask good questions, find and evaluate evidence, and communicate your thinking clearly.\nIf you engage seriously with that process, the grades will follow.\n\n\n  Questions?

Instagram users report feeling anxious after extended scrolling sessions, yet the app provides no built-in tools to moderate consumption. This creates a gap between user needs (mindful usage) and platform design (maximized engagement). I propose to investigate how design interventions—specifically, intentional friction like scroll limits—might reduce user anxiety without eliminating engagement entirely. Through semi-structured interviews (n=12) and diary studies, this research could contribute design principles for ethical engagement features applicable to social platforms broadly.”\nWhat’s right:\n\nCites existing research\nSpecific gap identified\nClear methodology\nStated contribution\n\n\n\n\nCredibility check: Could a stranger understand exactly what you’re studying and why it matters?

    "text": "Before You Begin\nYou might feel like you don’t know enough to do research. That’s normal — and it’s also backwards.\nResearch isn’t a demonstration of what you already know. It’s the practice of building knowledge in directions you’re curious about. You start from where you are, not from where you think you should be. The whole point is to end up somewhere new.\nEvery researcher — including your instructors, including published scholars — began by not knowing. The difference isn’t innate ability; it’s the willingness to sit with uncertainty and work through it systematically. That’s what this course teaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are building your own curriculum\n\n\n\nResearch is one of the few spaces where you set the agenda. You choose the question. You decide what matters. You develop expertise in a direction you find meaningful — not one handed to you. That’s uncomfortable at first, but it’s also where the real learning happens.\n\n\nDon’t wait until you feel “ready.” You become ready by doing the work.\nIf you hit a wall — you know what you want to investigate but not how to get there — that’s exactly what office hours are for. Bring your confusion. Bring your half-formed ideas. That’s not a sign of failure; it’s the normal state of research in progress. AI tools can help too, but sometimes a conversation cuts through faster."

The best research comes from authentic curiosity — not from trying to guess what the instructor wants.\n\n\nFollow your curiosity. What problems, questions, or phenomena do you find yourself thinking about? What would you want to understand better even if it weren’t for a grade?\nYour topic should be narrow enough to investigate meaningfully in one semester, but broad enough to find existing literature and evidence. It should connect to design, innovation, or the built environment — though this can be interpreted broadly.\nEmbrace uncertainty. You don’t need all the answers at the start. Research is a process of discovery, and your understanding will evolve. There is no “correct” topic. What matters is how rigorously you investigate it."

This is where you stake out your territory — articulating the problem you want to investigate and why it matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Stakes out a knowledge gap — what don’t we know yet that matters to your field?\nApplied Research: Stakes out a design opportunity — what problem is worth solving, and why now?\n\n\nWrite clearly and concisely (≤500 words). State the problem, explain its significance (both personally and broadly), and sketch your initial approach. If relevant, connect to sustainability or design implications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon pitfalls\n\n\n\nAbstracts should be plain text — no citations. Avoid being too broad (“I want to study sustainability”) or too narrow to find literature. Don’t just describe what you’ll study; explain why it matters.\n\n\nSuccess looks like: A clearly articulated, appropriately scoped problem. Genuine engagement with the topic. Logical connection between the problem and its significance.\n\n\n\nDocument 0.1: Literature Review\nA synthesis of existing research relevant to your topic. This is not a list of summaries — it’s an argument about the state of knowledge in your area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Surveys the scholarly conversation. Where does your question fit in the existing literature? What have others found?\nApplied Research: Surveys both research and market landscape. What exists (products, studies, precedents)? What’s missing or underserved?\n\n\nIdentify key sources (academic papers, books, reports). Summarize and critically evaluate each. Then synthesize: How do these sources relate to each other? Where do they agree or disagree? What patterns emerge? Most importantly — what’s missing? The gap you identify may be where your research contributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes a strong literature review\n\n\n\nOrganization matters. Structure your review thematically, chronologically, or methodologically — not just source-by-source. Show that you understand the landscape, not just individual papers.\n\n\nSuccess looks like: Relevant, credible, diverse sources. Demonstration of understanding, not just summary. Clear organizational logic. Identification of gaps. Proper citations.\n\n\n\nDocument 0.2: Collecting Evidence\nYour plan for gathering and analyzing data. Here you move from “what others have said” to “what I will find out.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Primary data to test a hypothesis or answer a research question. Methods should align with your field’s standards.\nApplied Research: Primary data to validate assumptions and inform design decisions. Focus on methods that reduce risk before building.\n\n\nDescribe your methodology — qualitative, quantitative, or mixed. Specify your methods: interviews, surveys, observations, archival research, experiments. Justify why these methods suit your research question. If you have preliminary data or pilot results, include them.\nBe honest about limitations. Every method has trade-offs. Acknowledging them shows sophistication, not weakness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon pitfalls\n\n\n\nDon’t choose methods because they’re easy — choose them because they’re appropriate. Vague analysis plans (“I will analyze the data”) don’t demonstrate understanding. Address ethical considerations where relevant.\n\n\nSuccess looks like: Methods appropriate for the question. Clear understanding of strengths and limitations. Concrete plan for collection and analysis. Honest engagement with potential biases.\n\n\n\nDocument 1: Research Paper Draft\nA near-complete research paper integrating all previous work. This is the culmination of your semester-long investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack-specific framing\n\n\n\nFrontier Research: Contributes new knowledge to a field — structured like a conference paper or journal article with clear academic contribution.\nApplied Research: Makes a case for a design direction — a design case study that shows how evidence informed your recommendation.\n\n\nYour paper should have a clear narrative arc: Introduction → Literature Review → Methodology → Findings → Discussion → Conclusion. Each section should build on and connect to the others. Include personal reflection on what you learned through the process.\n\nThe goal is not to have all the answers. Research often raises more questions than it answers. What matters is the rigor of your thinking and the honesty of your engagement with complexity.\n\nSuccess looks like: Clear narrative from question to conclusion. Strong integration of literature, methods, and findings. Quality writing and presentation. Thoughtful reflection on limitations and lessons learned."

This gives you the evening before to finalize, not scramble at 11:59 PM. Plan accordingly.\n\n\n\nOn Using AI\nAI tools are not prohibited — in fact, they’re welcome. Use them to enhance the quality of your writing, clarify your thinking, or get unstuck.\nThat said: if your submission reads like AI output without evident critical thinking — generic structure, surface-level analysis, no personal engagement with the material — the instructor may reach out to check whether you need additional support.\nThe goal is for AI to help you write better, not to write for you. You should be able to explain and stand behind everything in your submission — that’s how you know it’s still yours.\n\n\nLate Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne free extension — no questions asked\n\n\n\nLife happens. Every student gets one 7-day extension to use during the semester. No documentation required, no explanation needed. Just let the instructor know before the original deadline. Use it wisely.\n\n\nJust missed the deadline? If your submission is late but within 1 hour of the noon deadline, you may submit via Slack with a timestamp as proof. This receipt allows you to work with the instructor to update your Moodle record. Beyond 1 hour (i.e., after 1:00 PM), standard late penalties apply.\nLate penalties: Every 48 hours late = one sub-letter grade deduction (e.g., A → A-, then A- → B+, and so on). Exceptions beyond your free extension require a valid doctor’s note or equivalent documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfirm your submission record\n\n\n\nYour Moodle submission record must accurately reflect your work by the last day of teaching. Double-check that files are uploaded correctly and receipts are confirmed. Anything missing or incorrectly uploaded by that date will be treated as a non-submission — there won’t be an opportunity to fix it after the fact."
