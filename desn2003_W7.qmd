## Today's Shift
We've been building research skills in the classroom. Today we take them outside — into real conversations with practitioners. This is where your research question meets the real world.
:::

## Where You Should Be Right Now

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Week 7 Checkpoint

**You should have:**

1. A refined research question (evolved since W4 — that's normal)
2. Doc 0.1 submitted (feedback coming)
3. A sense of your methodology: qualitative, quantitative, or mixed

**Coming up fast:**

- Professional Discovery presentations: **Weeks 8–9** (group, in-class)
- Doc 0.2 (Methodology): **Week 10**
- Doc 1 (Research Paper): **Week 11** — this is the big one (contains upgraded versions of Doc 0, 0.1, and 0.2)

**If you're behind on any of these:** office hours this week. Don't wait.
:::

---

## Doc 0.1 Feedback: Quick Patterns

**What worked well:**

- Clear articulation of research focus
- Adequate number of sources

**Common areas for improvement:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Synthesis still reads as summary** — remember: theme first, sources as evidence (not paper-by-paper)
- **Formatting off** — check discipline conventions
- **Theoretical framework underdeveloped** — connect your work to existing theory
- **Conclusions included** — lit reviews don't conclude; they set up *your* contribution
:::

This is v0.2 — you'll upgrade all of this for Doc 1.

::: {.notes}
Update with cohort-specific stats each semester if desired.
:::

---

## Quick Reminder: Doc 1 Is the Release Candidate

::: {.nonincremental}
- Research paper format (~80% of a full paper)
- Contains: Abstract, Literature Review, Methodology, Hypothesis/Anticipated Conclusions, References
- **This is where your upgraded Doc 0 + 0.1 + 0.2 come together** — same components, better execution
- How is this different from a research proposal? (We'll discuss)

## Crafting Effective Cold Messages

### Key Components:

  1. Subject Line: Clear and engaging subject line that conveys the purpose of the message.
  2. Personalized Greetings: Use the recipient's name and personalized remark/compliment on recent accomplishments;
  3. Introduction and Purpose: brief but effective.
  4. Purpose Statement: seek advice, insights, experiences related to field of interest;
  5. Make Connection: highlight commonalities shared with recipient
  6. Express Genuine Interest
  7. Specific Request: Call to Action with Flexibility
  8. Politeness and Conciseness
  9. Closing and Signature

### Let's checkout some examples. Give a probability that you will respond to a message that you receive on LinkedIn. (3 Examples)


## Reaching Out:

#### Choosing the Right Platform:

  - **Platform Etiquette**: 
    - Norms and best practices for different platforms (LinkedIn, email, professional forums)
    - Initial outreach varies accordingly
  - **Professional Channels**: 
    - using professional channels for communication is important
    - make sure your profiles on these platforms are up-to-date and professional.
      - What do we mean by _professional_?

#### Timing and Frequency:

  - **Optimal Timing**: 
    - best times to send messages: avoiding weekends, late nights, and major holidays
    - the likelihood of a timely response improves accordingly.
  - **Follow-up Strategy**: 
    - follow-up strategy involves a waiting period (typically 1-2 weeks) 
    - a polite follow-up message if there's no initial response.


## Reaching Out (Continued)

#### Managing Outreach Volume:
  - **Tracking System**: 
    - set up a simple tracking system (like a spreadsheet) to monitor whom you’ve contacted, 
    - when, and any responses or follow-up actions needed.
  - **Balanced Approach**: 
    - ideally no mass messaging. 
    - a balanced, targeted approach to outreach, 
    - focusing on quality and personalization over quantity.

## Dealing with Responses:

#### Positive Responses:
  - **Immediate Acknowledgment**: 
    - respond promptly to positive replies, 
    - expressing gratitude for the willingness to engage and 
    - proposing potential times for the chat or meeting.
  - **Preparation**: 
    - being well-prepared for the interaction, 
    - with specific questions and goals in mind.

#### Negative or No Responses:
- **Handling Rejection**: 
  - not everyone will have the time or interest to respond
  - it’s not a reflection of their worth or the quality of their outreach.
  - aka it might be very frustrating.
- **Learning from Silence**: 
  - how would a lack of response offer learning opportunities? 
  - should you change your outreach strategy or message content?


## Know Your Client (KYC)

Do your homework so that you do not make mistakes.

#### Research Basics
  
  - Background Check: reviewing LinkedIn profile, professional biographies, recent publications, news mentions.
    - Thorough professional research before outreach
  - Understanding their work: 
    - familiarize with the professional's role/projects/contributions
    - understanding the context and significance of their work

#### Contextual Understanding
  - Know the Industry: major trends, challenges and opportunities
  - Company Culture: culture and values of where they work/associate with for talking points

## Know Your Client (KYC) Cont'd

#### Preparing Questions: Structured/Semi-structured
  - Informed Questions: **Informed and Open-Ended**, reflecting their research and curiosity about the professional 
  - Personalized Inquiry: avoid overly general or easily Google-able questions
  - Object-Oriented: what do you want to achieve through the interviews
    - get first-hand critique on the discipline
    - know what day-to-day is like at the particular industry
  - Set an agenda: what will happen if you don't have one?


## Activity: Research a Professional (10 min)
  - Do background research on a potential interviewee you might be interested in reaching out to
  - you should cover at least the following:
    - their professional role
    - list out companies they worked for
    - their career highlight/work most proud of
    - identify interviews/podcasts/presentation where they gave public opinion and based on those
    - come up with **two questions that you think is relevant to ask**

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Your Toolkits (from earlier weeks — use them now)

- **[Interview Protocol Template (PDF)](data/interview_protocol_template.pdf)** — Structure your Professional Discovery conversations the same way you'd structure a research interview. Opening, warm-up, core questions, closing.
- **[Worksheet: Qualitative Methods (PDF)](data/worksheet.pdf)** — Quick-reference for interview best practices.

These are the same tools from Week 5. The difference: now you're using them on real professionals, not classmates.
:::

<!-- - **Practical Exercise**: Arrange mock informational interviews where students can practice their research skills, question formulation, and conversational strategies in a supportive environment.

#### Research Presentation:
- **Group Activity**: Have students present their research findings about a professional to the group, including potential questions and conversation goals, to foster collective learning and feedback.
 -->

## Meet Your Client

#### Showing Engagement:
  - **Active Engagement**:
    - active listening, 
    - showing interest through body language (in person or on video calls), and 
    - asking follow-up questions based on the discussion.
  - **Note-taking**: 
    - taking brief notes during the conversation (with permission) to capture key points and advice,
    - demonstrates engagement and respect for the professional's insights.

#### Respect and Professionalism:
  - **Time Management**: 
    - be mindful of the agreed-upon time for the conversation and 
    - to avoid overextending unless the professional indicates they're willing to continue.
  - **Confidentiality**: 
    - the need to respect any confidential or sensitive information shared during the conversation.

## Meet Your Client (Continued)

### Post-Interaction Reflection:

#### Reflective Practice:
  - **Review and Reflect**: 
    - review their notes and reflect on the conversation soon after, 
    - identifying key learnings and any follow-up actions they might take.
  - **Feedback Loop**:
    - consider what went well and what could be improved for future interactions 
    - mindset of continuous improvement.

## Mock Interview (If we have time ~ 15min)
  
  - one-on-one practice: professional vs. student interviewer
  - work together and determine who the professional will shadow (a real person)
  - KYC on industry/persona individually
  - student interviewer to come up with 3 questions as structured interview and one follow-up during the conversation
  - student/professional to swap (if we have time)

# From Data to Insights

## The Analysis Gap

You've collected data. Now what?

- **Interviews completed** → pile of transcripts
- **Survey closed** → spreadsheet of responses
- **Observations done** → pages of field notes

**The hard part isn't collecting data. It's making sense of it.**

This section bridges that gap.

## Thematic Analysis: The 5-Step Process

The most common approach for qualitative data:

| Step | What You Do | Output |
|:-----|:------------|:-------|
| 1. **Familiarize** | Read everything twice. Note first impressions. | Margin notes |
| 2. **Code** | Label meaningful chunks (phrases, sentences) | Code list |
| 3. **Search for themes** | Group related codes together | Theme candidates |
| 4. **Review themes** | Check if themes hold up across data | Refined themes |
| 5. **Define & name** | Write 1-sentence definition for each theme | Final themes |

## Step 1: Familiarize — Read Without Agenda

**First pass:** Read everything without highlighting. Just absorb.

**Second pass:** Note anything that:
- Surprises you
- Repeats across participants
- Contradicts what you expected
- Feels emotionally charged

**Anti-pattern:** Jumping straight to coding. You'll miss the forest for the trees.

## Step 2: Code — Label Meaningful Chunks

A **code** = short label for a piece of data

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Quote:**
> "I check my likes within 10 minutes of posting. I literally can't help it. It's like my thumb just goes there."

**Possible codes:**
- Compulsive checking
- Loss of control
- Automatic behavior
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Code types:**

- **Descriptive:** What's happening
- **In-vivo:** Participant's own words
- **Process:** Actions/verbs
- **Emotion:** Feelings expressed
:::
:::

## Step 3: Search for Themes — Cluster Codes

Spread your codes out (physically or digitally). Look for patterns.

| Code Cluster | Potential Theme |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| Compulsive checking, can't stop, automatic | **Checking as habit loop** |
| Feel bad, anxious, disappointed | **Emotional cost of low engagement** |
| Compare to friends, feel behind, jealous | **Social comparison trap** |
| Delete posts, edit captions, time posts | **Performance management strategies** |

**A theme is not a code.** A theme is a pattern that says something meaningful about your research question.

## Step 4: Review Themes — Stress Test

For each candidate theme, ask:

- [ ] Does it appear across multiple participants (not just one)?
- [ ] Does the data actually support it, or am I projecting?
- [ ] Is it distinct from other themes, or should they merge?
- [ ] Does it matter for my research question?

**Kill themes that don't hold up.** 3-5 strong themes > 10 weak ones.

## Step 5: Define & Name — Make It Stick

Each final theme needs:

1. **A clear name** (not jargon, not vague)
2. **A 1-sentence definition**
3. **Representative quotes** (2-3 per theme)

| Theme | Definition |
|:------|:-----------|
| **Compulsive checking loop** | Participants describe checking likes as automatic, habitual behavior they feel unable to control. |
| **Like thresholds as self-worth** | Participants set mental benchmarks for "acceptable" like counts; falling short triggers negative self-evaluation. |
| **Performance management** | Participants actively curate posting behavior (timing, deletion, editing) to optimize engagement metrics. |

## Worked Example: From 12 Interviews to 4 Themes

**Research question:** How do HKU students experience Instagram like-checking?

**Raw data:** 12 interviews, 45 pages of transcripts

**Coding:** 47 initial codes identified

**Final themes:**

1. **Compulsive checking loop** (10/12 participants)
2. **Like thresholds as self-worth** (8/12 participants)
3. **Social comparison with peers** (9/12 participants)
4. **Temporary validation effect** (7/12 participants)

Each theme has 2-3 supporting quotes and a clear definition.

---

## Architecture/Urban Example: Analyzing Interviews About Public Space

**Research question:** How do Hong Kong residents perceive rule enforcement in privately-owned public spaces?

**Raw data:** 8 interviews with regular users of POPS in Central

**Sample codes:**
- "Security told me to move" → *enforcement encounter*
- "I didn't know I couldn't sit there" → *unclear rules*
- "It doesn't feel like public space" → *ownership ambiguity*
- "I just avoid those places now" → *behavioral adaptation*

**Emerging themes:**

| Theme | Definition | Prevalence |
|:------|:-----------|:-----------|
| **Invisible boundaries** | Users discover rules only through enforcement, not signage | 6/8 |
| **Chilling effect** | Negative encounters lead to avoidance of space entirely | 5/8 |
| **Public-private confusion** | Users unsure who controls space and what rights they have | 7/8 |

**So what?** Designers should consider how rule communication affects perceived publicness.

## For Quantitative Data: From Numbers to Patterns

| What You Have | What You Do | What It Tells You |
|:--------------|:------------|:------------------|
| Survey responses (Likert) | Calculate means, SD | Central tendency & spread |
| Two groups to compare | t-test or Mann-Whitney | Whether difference is real |
| Two variables | Correlation (Pearson/Spearman) | Whether they move together |
| Multiple predictors | Regression | Which factors matter most |

**Key question:** Is the pattern real, or just noise?

- p < 0.05 → statistically significant (probably not random)
- Effect size → practically significant (big enough to matter)

## Triangulation: When Qual and Quant Meet

| Finding | Qual Evidence | Quant Evidence | Agreement? |
|:--------|:--------------|:---------------|:-----------|
| Checking frequency → anxiety | "I feel anxious when I check" (10/12) | r = 0.42, p < .001 | ✓ Converge |
| Likes = self-worth | "I feel like a failure" (8/12) | Not directly measured | Partial |
| Hiding likes would help | "I'd feel relieved" (6/12) | 45% selected "would reduce stress" | ✓ Converge |

**When they disagree:** That's interesting data, not a problem. Ask why.

## The "So What?" Test

For every finding, ask: **Why should anyone care?**

| Finding | So What? |
|:--------|:---------|
| r = 0.42 correlation between checking and anxiety | Moderate effect — not everyone, but meaningful signal for intervention design |
| 10/12 describe compulsive checking | Design friction (delays, nudges) might break the automatic loop |
| Social comparison drives checking | Hiding like counts removes the comparison trigger |

If you can't answer "so what?" — the finding isn't ready.
