## Refresher on Introduction to Literature Review

### Purpose and Objectives

- **Definition:** A comprehensive survey of publications relevant to a research topic.
- **Purpose:** Establishes context, identifies gaps, and justifies new research.

### Key Objectives

- Synthesize existing knowledge.
- Identify research gaps and questions.
- Inform methodology.
- Ground research in existing literature.

## Types of Literature Reviews

### Narrative Review

- Broad, subjective overview.
- Thematic analysis of literature.

### Systematic Review

- Structured, transparent approach.
- Answers specific research questions.

### Meta-Analysis

- Combines data from multiple studies.
- Statistical analysis to find effect size.

### Scoping Review

- Maps key concepts, types of evidence.
- Informative for research areas.

::: {.notes}
Think of literature reviews like recipes for making a cake.

* **Narrative Review**: A creative recipe with no specific ingredients or 
quantities. It's like following your grandma's "secret" recipe that works 
well but is hard to replicate.
  + Example: A general overview of the field, summarizing key points without 
quantitative data.
* **Thematic Analysis**: A systematic approach to categorize and 
understand different flavors (themes) in a cake.
  + Example: Analyzing literature on a specific topic, identifying patterns 
or themes that emerge from the studies.
* **Systematic Review**: A structured recipe book with detailed 
instructions, using established methods to find all relevant ingredients.
  + Example: Following a well-defined protocol to gather and synthesize all 
existing research on a particular question or intervention.
* **Meta-Analysis**: A statistical analysis of multiple cake recipes to 
identify the "best" combination of ingredients.
  + Example: Quantitatively combining data from multiple studies to estimate 
the overall effect size or outcome.
* **Scoping Review**: A rough sketch of different types of cakes and their 
ingredients, helping you understand what's out there.
  + Example: Gathering information on a broad topic, identifying key 
concepts, and understanding the types of evidence available.

  - informs your own research design, 
  - ensuring usage of the most suitable approach for their project.
- **Evidence-based practice**: 
  - As future practitioners or scholars
  - need to evaluate and apply existing knowledge effectively, 
  - making informed decisions based on high-quality evidence.
- **Critical thinking**: 
  - develops critical thinking skills

- **MLA:** Author(s). "Title of Book." Title of Container, other contributors, version, numbers, Publisher, publication date.
- **Chicago:** Author, Title, Publisher, Year of publication.

## Face-off: Citation Managers:

To compare Zotero, EndNote, Mendeley, and RefWorks in terms of usability, integration, and cost, a comparison table can be quite effective. Here's a simplified overview:

Certainly, here's a more concise comparison table for Zotero, EndNote, Mendeley, and RefWorks:

| Feature       | Zotero             | EndNote          | Mendeley          | RefWorks          |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Usability** | User-friendly, open-source. | Professional, feature-rich. | User-friendly with social features. | Simple and intuitive. |
| **Integration** | Excellent browser and word processor support. | Strong with Microsoft Word and LaTeX. | Good with browsers and Microsoft Word, includes PDF annotator. | Good with academic databases and library systems. |
| **Cost**      | Free.              | Expensive, varies by institution. | Free basic, premium features cost extra. | Often free through institutions, otherwise subscription-based. |

## TLDR Notes on Citation Managers
- <span style="color:red">**Zotero**</span>: Highly regarded for its ease of use and flexibility, community-developed plugins
- **EndNote**: Most comprehensive citation management tools. Costly.
- **Mendeley**: Popular for PDF annotation features and social networking.
- **RefWorks**: Straightforward approach to reference management, appealing for those new to research.

# Ready to dive into literature review with your selected topic? 

<!-- ## Let's perhaps turn back to what you submitted first.

## 19/20 Submissions

- Late submission will result in 10% reduction of grade obtained.
- Good avoidance of plagiarism
  - practice paraphrasing where fit.
- Make your proposal abstract-ready
- Abstract & Citations
- Introduction (prelim data) and Background (importance/research gap identified)
- Over-promise

 -->
## Something you hopefully have already done: Scoping to a research topic

  1. What time period do you want to focus on? **WHEN** - Time
  2. What location would you like to focus on? **WHERE** - Location
  3. What category would you like to focus on? **WHAT** - Category
  4. What perspective, point of view or issue do you wish to capture? **Issue**

## Having a clear research question:

Does this research proposal:

  1. Define topic area
  2. Describe the problem
  3. Specify the gap & justify the investigation
  4. Draw out one (or a few) research questions

## IN-Session: 
1. Sign up for research rabbit, scispace or your platform of choice and identify three articles to 'shadow'.
2. Compare the three ariticle's abstract and your write-up insofar, identify the one that is closest structurally to your writeup and compare:
  - How are they different?
  - Where do you think you could/should change?
  - Are you potentially over-promising?
  - Can you make your research more 'real' and 'personal'?
  - How are they different structurally? 

<!-- **You have 10 minutes.** -->

## Assess & Refine
- Evaluate the question
    - Do you understand it on first reading?
    - Is the research feasible given the time and resources that we have?
    - Does it contribute to a wider (academic) conversation?
- Tighten your focus
    - Look at the extracted research question and see if thereâ€™s any vagueness in wording: e.g. teenagers to Grade 9-10 students in HK
- Talk it over
    - Leverage this assessment criteria and discuss what you think of the current paper
- Revision suggestions
    - Any suggestions that you have for the authors when reading through this entire writeup?

## Take five minutes to look at your own submission right now.
