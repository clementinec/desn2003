FEEDBACK PRINCIPLES FOR ITERATIVE DOCS
DESN2003: Research for Innovation
=======================================

PURPOSE: Reference this each time you sit down to grade Doc 0, 0.1, or 0.2.
The goal is not to grade a finished product — it's to give each student
the ONE or TWO moves that will most improve their next version.


CORE PRINCIPLES
---------------

1. DIAGNOSE, DON'T DESCRIBE
   Bad:  "Your scope is too broad."
   Good: "Your RQ asks about 'social media and anxiety' — that's a topic,
          not a question. Pick ONE platform and ONE mechanism. If you keep
          Instagram, try: 'How does [specific feature] affect [specific
          outcome] among [specific population]?'"

   The student should be able to act on your feedback without needing
   a follow-up conversation.

2. ONE MOVE, NOT TEN
   Identify the single highest-leverage change. If the RQ is unfocused,
   fixing the RQ fixes everything downstream — don't also comment on
   citation formatting. Students can only absorb 1-2 structural changes
   per iteration. Save the rest for the next round.

   Priority order for what to fix:
   - Research question clarity (if this is wrong, nothing else matters)
   - Gap ↔ question alignment (are they studying what they say is missing?)
   - Evidence ↔ argument alignment (does the lit review support the gap?)
   - Method ↔ question fit (can this method actually answer this question?)
   - Scope calibration (too broad / too narrow for one semester?)
   - Writing quality (synthesis vs summary, structure, clarity)
   - Formatting and conventions (last priority — never lead with this)

3. POINT THEM BACK TO A TOOL
   Every piece of feedback should connect to something actionable:
   - "Run your revised question through the Research Question Builder —
     check the FINER criteria on page 1."
   - "Use the Landscape Canvas Section 3 to map what these sources
     actually tell you vs. what's still unknown."
   - "Open the Survey Design Checklist and check questions 4 and 7
     against the bias patterns on page 2."

   This reinforces the toolkit as useful and gives them a next step
   that doesn't require you.

4. NAME WHAT'S WORKING
   Start with one specific thing they did well — not generic praise
   ("good work") but evidence that you read it ("Your choice to focus
   on HK public housing residents is smart — it's a bounded, accessible
   population that connects to real policy debates").

   This isn't about being nice. It's about helping them identify their
   own strengths so they can replicate them.

5. USE THE VERSION LANGUAGE
   Frame feedback as iteration, not correction:
   - "For v0.2, the main move is..."
   - "This is solid for a first pass. The upgrade for Doc 1 is..."
   - "You don't need to fix everything now — but for the next version,
     focus on..."

   This reduces defensiveness and reinforces that rough drafts are
   expected and normal.


DOC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE
---------------------

DOC 0 (Extended Abstract — v0.1)
  What you're looking for:
  - Is there a real problem, not just a topic area?
  - Is there a gap, or just an interest?
  - Can you see the seed of a research question?
  - Is the scope plausible for one semester?

  Common patterns and how to respond:

  PATTERN: Topic masquerading as a question
  Signal:  "I want to research sustainability in design"
  Response: "You've identified an area but not a question yet. What
            specifically about sustainability? What population? What
            outcome would you measure? Try the Research Question Builder
            — the Who/What/Where/When/How template on page 1 will help
            you narrow this."

  PATTERN: Gap and question misaligned
  Signal:  Gap says "no research on X" but question asks about Y
  Response: "Your gap is about [X] but your question pivots to [Y].
            These are two different studies. Pick one direction. If you
            keep [X], your question should ask about [X]. If [Y] is more
            interesting to you, rewrite the gap to justify why [Y] is
            understudied."

  PATTERN: Scope too ambitious
  Signal:  "I will survey 500 users and conduct 30 interviews"
  Response: "Scale this back. For a one-semester project: 5-8 interviews
            OR a survey of 30-50 respondents is realistic. Pick the method
            that best fits your question type (descriptive → interviews,
            relational → survey). Quality over quantity."

  PATTERN: Scope too narrow / trivial
  Signal:  "Does button color affect clicks?"
  Response: "This is testable but the answer won't contribute much.
            Ask yourself: even if you proved blue beats red, so what?
            Who benefits? What changes? Push toward a question where
            the answer has design implications beyond one button."


DOC 0.1 (Literature Review — v0.2)
  What you're looking for:
  - Synthesis, not summary (themes across sources, not source-by-source)
  - Does the review build toward the gap?
  - Are sources credible and relevant?
  - Does the student evaluate sources, not just report them?

  Common patterns and how to respond:

  PATTERN: Book report style (source-by-source summary)
  Signal:  "Smith (2020) found X. Jones (2021) found Y. Lee (2022) found Z."
  Response: "You're summarizing papers individually — that's a reading list,
            not a review. Try this: lead with the THEME, then use sources
            as evidence. Example: 'Multiple studies suggest that passive
            social media use undermines well-being (Smith, 2020; Jones,
            2021), though the mechanism differs by platform (Lee, 2022).'
            One paragraph, three sources, one argument."

  PATTERN: No critical lens
  Signal:  Accepts all sources at face value, no mention of limitations
  Response: "You're reporting what others found but not evaluating it.
            For each key source, ask: What couldn't they answer? What's
            the limitation? That limitation is often where YOUR study
            fits in. Add one sentence per major source: 'However, [study]
            was limited by [X], leaving [Y] unexamined.'"

  PATTERN: Literature doesn't connect to their question
  Signal:  Sources are broadly related but don't build toward the gap
  Response: "These sources are interesting but I can't see how they
            connect to YOUR question. For each source, ask: does this
            support my gap, challenge it, or provide methodology I can
            borrow? If it doesn't do one of these three things, it
            might not belong in your review."

  PATTERN: Too few sources / surface-level engagement
  Signal:  3-4 sources, each cited once, no depth
  Response: "You need more landscape coverage. Use Connected Papers or
            Semantic Scholar to find the citation network around your
            strongest source — there are likely 5-10 more papers in
            that cluster that are directly relevant. Aim for 8-12
            sources minimum. Sections 3-4 of the Landscape Canvas
            can help you organize what you find."


DOC 0.2 (Methodology — v0.3)
  What you're looking for:
  - Does the method match the question type?
  - Is the design specific enough to execute?
  - Are practical constraints acknowledged?
  - Is there a clear data collection plan?

  Common patterns and how to respond:

  PATTERN: Method doesn't match question
  Signal:  Causal question ("Does X cause Y?") but plans to do interviews
  Response: "Your question asks whether X causes Y — that's a causal
            question that needs a controlled comparison (experiment or
            A/B test). Interviews can tell you WHY something happens
            but not WHETHER it does. Either change your method to match
            the question, or change your question to match what
            interviews can answer (e.g., 'How do users experience X?')."

  PATTERN: Vague data collection plan
  Signal:  "I will conduct interviews and analyze the data"
  Response: "This is too vague to execute. Specify: How many interviews?
            With whom (what population, how recruited)? What questions
            (use the Interview Protocol Template)? How will you analyze
            transcripts (thematic analysis? codes?)? Your methodology
            section should be specific enough that someone else could
            replicate your study."

  PATTERN: Over-designed / too many methods
  Signal:  "I will do 20 interviews, a survey of 200, and an A/B test"
  Response: "Pick one primary method and do it well. If you want mixed
            methods, sequence them: interviews first (5-8, to explore),
            then a short survey (30-50, to validate patterns). Cut the
            A/B test — you won't have time or access to run one properly
            this semester."

  PATTERN: No limitations acknowledged
  Signal:  Presents plan as if it will produce definitive answers
  Response: "Every method has limitations — name yours. Sample size,
            self-report bias, convenience sampling, generalizability.
            Acknowledging limitations isn't weakness; it's rigor.
            Reviewers trust researchers who know what they can't claim."


FEEDBACK TEMPLATES
------------------

Use these as starting structures. Personalize the bracketed parts.

TEMPLATE 1: Standard feedback (most submissions)
  "Strong [specific thing they did well]. For the next version,
  the main move is [one specific change]. Try [specific action
  using a specific tool]. This will [concrete benefit for their
  project]."

TEMPLATE 2: Student is lost
  "I can see you're interested in [area], but the project needs
  a sharper focus before it can move forward. Here's what I'd
  suggest: [one concrete next step]. If this feels unclear, come
  to office hours this week — 15 minutes of conversation will
  save you hours of spinning."

TEMPLATE 3: Student is strong — push them further
  "This is solid work — [specific praise]. You're ready for a
  harder question: [challenge that pushes them beyond current
  level]. This is what would take your Doc 1 from good to
  genuinely interesting."

TEMPLATE 4: Student needs to restart direction
  "I want to be honest: [current direction] isn't going to work
  because [specific reason]. But the underlying interest in [X]
  is real. Here's an alternative angle that keeps what's interesting
  and makes it researchable: [suggested pivot]. This isn't starting
  over — it's zooming in on the strongest part of what you have."


PACING YOURSELF
---------------

Realistic time budget per student per doc round:
  - Read: 3-5 min
  - Diagnose the one move: 1-2 min
  - Write feedback: 3-5 min
  - Total: ~10 min per student

If you have 30 students, that's ~5 hours per doc round.
Three doc rounds = ~15 hours across the semester.

Shortcut that doesn't sacrifice quality:
  - Batch by pattern. Read all submissions first, tag each with
    the pattern (topic-not-question, book-report-style, etc.).
    Then write feedback for each pattern group — the diagnosis
    is the same, you just personalize the specific example.
  - Address the top 3 patterns as a class (you're already doing
    this in the W5 and W7 opening slides). Then individual
    feedback only needs to say: "Your version of the [pattern]
    problem is [specific instance]. See the class slide for the
    general fix; here's what it means for YOUR project: [one
    sentence]."


TONE & VOICE
------------

Your feedback voice should feel like a senior colleague at a whiteboard,
not a judge with a rubric. Direct, warm, specific, and always forward-
looking. The student should finish reading and think "I know exactly
what to do next" — not "I did badly" or "this was fine I guess."

1. DIRECT BUT NOT BLUNT
   You're allowed to be honest. Students respect clarity. But deliver
   honesty with a path forward, not just a verdict.

   Too blunt:   "This isn't a research question."
   Too soft:    "Maybe consider refining your question a little?"
   Right tone:  "This reads as a topic right now, not a question —
                 but the fix is straightforward. Try narrowing to
                 one population and one measurable outcome."

   The pattern: [honest diagnosis] + [but here's the move].

2. SPEAK TO THE WORK, NOT THE PERSON
   Never: "You didn't understand the assignment."
   Always: "The abstract describes a topic area but doesn't yet
            contain a specific research question."

   This isn't just politeness — it keeps feedback about craft,
   which students can improve, not about ability, which feels fixed.

3. BE SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO ACT ON
   Vague:    "Needs more depth."
   Specific: "Your literature review covers 4 sources but treats
              each one in isolation. Pick the two most relevant,
              and write one paragraph that puts them in conversation
              — where do they agree? Where do they diverge?"

   The test: could the student sit down and start revising within
   5 minutes of reading your comment? If not, it's too vague.

4. CALIBRATE ENTHUSIASM TO EVIDENCE
   Don't inflate praise. Students can tell when "great work!" means
   "I didn't read this carefully." Specific praise is believed;
   generic praise is dismissed.

   Generic:  "Great job on the lit review!"
   Specific: "Your synthesis of the three social comparison studies
              is strong — you identified the methodological gap across
              all three, which sets up your contribution clearly."

   One sentence of specific praise > three sentences of generic
   encouragement. If you can't name what's good, don't claim it is.

5. MATCH LENGTH TO NEED
   Not every student needs a paragraph. Strong work might need two
   sentences: one acknowledging what's working, one pushing further.
   Struggling work needs more scaffolding, but still no more than
   one short paragraph — remember the "one move" principle.

   Strong student:  2-3 sentences. Acknowledge + challenge.
   Average student: 3-5 sentences. Diagnose + redirect + tool.
   Struggling student: 4-6 sentences. Validate effort + name the
                       core issue + give one concrete next step +
                       invite to office hours.

   Never write a page of feedback. If you need that much space,
   the student needs a conversation, not a comment.

6. FORWARD-LOOKING, NOT BACKWARD-FACING
   Students can't change what they submitted. They can change what
   they submit next. Every comment should point forward.

   Backward: "You should have included more sources."
   Forward:  "For the next version, use Connected Papers to find
              5-6 more sources in the citation network around
              your strongest reference."

   Even when something is wrong, frame the fix as an opportunity
   rather than a correction: "The upgrade here is..." not "The
   problem here is..."

7. USE THEIR OWN WORDS
   When possible, quote their submission back to them. This proves
   you read it, makes the feedback feel personal, and grounds
   abstract advice in their specific work.

   "You wrote: 'Social media has many effects on mental health.'
   That's a topic. Try: 'How does [one specific feature] affect
   [one specific outcome] among [one specific population]?' — same
   interest, much sharper frame."


WRITING FEEDBACK: WORKED EXAMPLES
----------------------------------

Below are full feedback examples at different student levels.
Use these as calibration — not scripts, but reference points for
the level of specificity and tone to aim for.

EXAMPLE A: Solid student, Doc 0 (needs RQ sharpening)

  "Your focus on accessibility in Hong Kong's MTR system is well-
  chosen — it's specific, locally relevant, and has both policy and
  design implications. The gap you've identified (limited research
  on wayfinding for visually impaired commuters) is real. For v0.2,
  the main move is turning this gap into a question: something like
  'What wayfinding barriers do visually impaired commuters encounter
  in MTR stations, and how do current design interventions address
  or fail them?' Run it through the Research Question Builder (page 1)
  to check scope and feasibility."

  Why this works:
  - Specific praise (names their topic, says why it's strong)
  - One move (gap → question)
  - Suggests a draft question (models what "sharper" looks like)
  - Points to a tool
  - 80 words total

EXAMPLE B: Struggling student, Doc 0.1 (book report style)

  "I can see the effort here — you found 6 relevant sources and each
  summary is accurate. The next step is synthesis: instead of
  describing each paper separately, try grouping them by what they
  agree on. For example, three of your sources (Chen, Park, and Liu)
  all study notification overload but measure it differently. One
  paragraph that puts them in conversation — 'Multiple studies have
  examined notification overload (Chen, 2020; Park, 2021; Liu, 2023),
  though measurement approaches vary from self-report (Chen) to
  behavioral logging (Liu)' — would be a significant upgrade. See
  the synthesis example from the Week 5 slides if you want a model.
  This is the single biggest improvement you can make for Doc 1."

  Why this works:
  - Validates effort (found sources, summaries are accurate)
  - Names the pattern (book report) without using that label
  - Shows the fix with their actual sources (not abstract advice)
  - Provides a rewritten sentence they can use as a model
  - Points to a resource
  - Names this as the ONE thing to focus on
  - 130 words — longer because the student needs more scaffolding

EXAMPLE C: Strong student, Doc 0.2 (ready to be pushed)

  "Your methodology section is clear and well-justified — semi-
  structured interviews with 8 HK design students, thematic
  analysis, good rationale for why qual fits your exploratory RQ.
  You're beyond the basics. The challenge for Doc 1: your interview
  guide has 12 questions, several of which overlap. Cut it to 7-8
  and make each one earn its place. Also consider: what would ONE
  well-chosen quantitative measure add? Even a short pre/post
  survey (5 items) would let you triangulate. Not required — but
  it's what would take this from a strong student project to
  something with real publication potential."

  Why this works:
  - Specific, evidence-based praise
  - Pushes beyond what's required (overlap in questions, triangulation)
  - Plants the seed of publication without pressuring
  - Challenges without undermining confidence
  - 110 words

EXAMPLE D: Student who needs to pivot, Doc 0

  "Your interest in how AI affects creativity is genuine and timely.
  But right now, 'How does AI affect creativity?' is a topic, not
  a question — you could write ten dissertations here. More
  importantly, 'creativity' is very hard to measure in a one-semester
  study. Here's an angle that keeps what's interesting and makes it
  researchable: pick ONE creative task (e.g., ideation in a design
  studio) and ONE AI tool (e.g., Midjourney), and ask how students
  experience the tool during that task. Something like: 'How do
  design students describe the role of Midjourney in their ideation
  process?' — that's an interview study you can actually do this
  semester. Come to office hours if you want to talk through the
  pivot."

  Why this works:
  - Validates the interest ("genuine and timely")
  - Honest about why current direction won't work (too broad,
    creativity hard to measure)
  - Offers a concrete alternative, not just "narrow it down"
  - Frames as zooming in, not starting over
  - Explicit office hours invitation
  - 150 words — justified because a pivot needs more explanation


WHAT NOT TO DO
--------------

- Don't lead with formatting issues. Students fixate on what you
  mention first. If you start with "fix your citation style,"
  they'll fix citations and ignore the structural problem.

- Don't give 10 comments. They'll address the easiest two and
  ignore the rest. One structural comment > ten surface comments.

- Don't just say "good work" to strong students. They need to be
  pushed too. "This is strong — now here's what would make it
  excellent" respects their effort and challenges them.

- Don't use feedback to teach content you'll cover later. If their
  methodology is weak but you haven't taught methods yet (e.g.,
  Doc 0 is submitted before W5), say "we'll cover this in Week 5 —
  for now, just note that your question implies [X] kind of data."

- Don't rewrite their work for them. Diagnose the problem, point
  to the tool, suggest the direction. They do the revision.

- Don't use red-pen energy. Avoid "you failed to," "you neglected,"
  "this is wrong," "unfortunately." Use "the next move is," "the
  upgrade here is," "try this," "the gap between your current
  version and the next one is."

- Don't hedge excessively. "Maybe you could perhaps consider
  possibly narrowing your scope a little bit?" is not feedback.
  "Narrow your scope. Pick one platform and one population." is.
  Be kind, be direct. These are not in conflict.

- Don't copy-paste the same comment to multiple students. Even if
  the pattern is the same, personalize the one sentence that names
  THEIR specific instance. "Your version of this: [quote their
  work]" takes 30 seconds and makes the difference between feedback
  that feels generic and feedback that feels seen.
