## Submit Your Document 0 next week!

Length: ≤ 500 words

  - Expand beyond what you've written before
  - Think critically at how much better you could've written this

Style: Extended Abstract

  - Should contain what you normally see in normal abstracts
  - Can contain additional bullet points and outlines on what do you propose to do next or potential outcomes


## Let's start by looking at some research paper examples

As seen on Moodle

  1. [Hong Kong Compression](./data/compressing_construction_durations_lessonslearnt_HK.pdf)
  2. [Fashion, Sustainability, Innovations and Energy](./data/InnoFashion.pdf) + __interview-heavy__

## Literature Review, an Overview

### Objectives:

At end of this session being able to:

- __explain what__ the review of literature is;
- __identify__ and __describe__ the objectives and sources of the review of literature;
- __explain the function__ of literature review serves;
- know where to start to __conduct the review of literature__ and 
- __aware__ of precautions a researcher should take into consideration in library use;
- getting warmed up on various __literature review formats__
 

## On literature review

Literature + Review:

- <span style="color:red">literature</span>: language, knowledge of an area of investigation of **any** discipline on its investigations of 
  - theoretical
  - pratical
  - any relevant reserach studies
- <span style="color:yellow">review</span>: knowledge organised, show why current study might be an addition to the field:
  - often seen at graduate level
  - considered creative and tedious at the same time
  - synthesizing available knowledge in **unique way** as to
  - provide <span style="color:magenta">value-add</span> on top of the existing research 

## Two phases of literature review

Phase One: Catch-them-all

  - ID all relevant publications within your problem space
  - Read/Skim through more relevant ones and broaden your understanding
  - Critique on how/why some of them is (not) adequate in what they claim

Phase Two:  Write on Relevance
  
  - Synthesize your findings on the literature into writings
  - Present **your own evaluation** of the literature that you found relevant, _both good and bad_
  - Your background, reader's roadmap of how your arguments are paved

## Why do we need literature review?

- To understand the research landscape
- To avoid repetitive work
- To ascertain innovation and research excellence (if any)
- **To identify additional research gap (if any)**

## Realistically, Literature Review Provides us a stock of:

- Theories, ideas, explanations or hypotheses;
- Record to check against for repetition;
- Possible method, procedure, sources of data suitable to even a new problem;
- Relevant conclusions drawn in the related studies;

## Common Sources of Literature

- Books; 
- (Academic) Journals;
- Abstracts;
- Encyclopaedias;
- Handbooks and Guides;
- Special Dictionaries;
- Dissertations and Theses;
- Anything off the search Engine.

## Functions of Literatures

1. Provides conceptual frame of refrence for contemplated research
2. Helps generate an understanding of status of current field
3. Points to possible choice of research methodology, instrumentation & data needed for analysis
4. Demonstrate why proposed research is needed and provides roadmap to success;

## Expanding on Phase One of Literature Review

Repeat this on each of the sources that you came across

1. RELEVANCE? Gain general impression of what the selected source is
  - what is it trying to answer aka research question 
  - how is the source structured
  - whether the problem identified was tackled and how
  - any relevant questions put forward

2. HOW MIGHT IT HELP YOU? Consider how the source would help you
  - Does it answer (a part) of your research question?
  - Where are the answers/evidence located in the source
---

3. HOW DOES IT HELP? Read more on the source and at depth to understand

  - How well does the source answer your question
  - What are its limitations (if there are any)
4. WRITE YOUR NOTES DOWN.

  - Who wrote this and when and where (citation manager like Zotero)  
  - Why did you find it relevant and how does it help your case

## Precautions

- Avoid intellectual dishonesty: Write and think on your own
- Practice critical thinking: Do it on your own standing
- Liteature review is not relisting previous studies
- Always helpful to arrange studies in chronological order before categorizing them on fields/relevance

# What is a Literature Review?

- **Overview:**  
  - Summarizes existing research  
  - Identifies gaps and informs new studies  
- **In Design:**  
  - Grounds your project in current thinking  
  - Guides design decisions with evidence

---

# What is an Annotated Bibliography?

- **Definition:**  
  - A list of sources with summaries and evaluations
- **Components:**  
  - **Citation:** Standard reference  
  - **Summary:** Main ideas/findings  
  - **Evaluation:** Strengths & limitations  
  - **Relevance:** How it informs your topic

---

# Example Annotation

**Citation:**  
Smith, J. (2020). *Designing Trust: UI Elements and User Experience*. Journal of HCI.

**Annotation:**  
This study examines how minimalist UI designs impact user trust through A/B testing. It finds that simplified layouts reduce cognitive load and increase user confidence. 

- **Strengths:** Robust methodology and clear data analysis. 
- **Limitations:** Focuses solely on e-commerce, limiting broader applicability. 
- **Relevance:** Offers empirical support for design decisions in UI/UX, aligning with our research question.

# Group Instructions

- **Form Groups:** 3-4 members
- **Task:**  
  - Use online libraries & digital tools to find **3+ diverse sources**  
  - Record: Title, Author, Year, Source Type  
  - Jot down a brief note on why each source is relevant  
- **Focus:** Keep the lens on UI/UX, HCI, and architecture

---

# Scavenger Hunt Tips

- Search for varied sources:  
  - Academic articles, book chapters, industry reports  
- Use targeted keywords:  
  - "UI design", "user experience", "HCI", "architectural design"  
- Verify source credibility and publication date

---

# Annotated Bibliography Task

- For each source, write a **100-150 word annotation** including:
  - **Summary:** What does the source say?  
  - **Evaluation:** How reliable and useful is it?  
  - **Relevance:** How does it connect to your research question?

---

# How It All Works Together

1. **Scavenger Hunt:**  
   - Gather a variety of credible sources on your topic  
2. **Annotated Bibliography:**  
   - Analyze and synthesize your findings  
   - Create a critical framework for your literature review

---

# Wrap-Up & Sharing

- **Sharing:**  
  - Each group presents one annotated entry  
  - Discuss insights and any challenges encountered
- **Q&A:** Open the floor for questions and reflections

---

# Reflection

- How do these exercises mirror real-world research?  
- What next steps would you take in building your literature review?
