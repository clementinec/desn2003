## 8. Sample Size & Credibility

**My target sample size:** 150 **Realistic?** [x] Yes

**Recruitment strategy:**
- Post in 5 HKU faculty Facebook groups (reach ~2000 students)
- Share in 3 course WhatsApp groups
- Ask 2 professors to announce in class
- Offer chance to win 1 of 5 $100 HKD gift cards as incentive

**Credibility note:** Using validated GAD-7 scale means my anxiety measure is already tested for reliability — I don't need to defend my anxiety questions, only my like-checking questions.
