# Reflecting on Literature Review Submissions

## How did we do with the literature reivew (Doc 0.1) submissions
  - Basic stats:
    - Median word counts: 1611
    - Median # of citations: 12
    - Avg. paragraph: 5
  - The Goods
    - Well articulated
  - The Not-so-greats
    - Lacks synergies with literature reviews in relevant fields
      - formatting
      - lengths
      - contains conclusions
    - Limited theoretical framework/backing

 <!-- Take architectural history as an example? -->

## Quick flash back on Document 1 submission

  - Research-paper like
  - ~80% of work needed to draft a research paper as it contains:
    - Abstract
    - Literature Review
    - Methodology
    - Hypothesis/Anticipated Conclusions
    - Relevant References
  - How is this different from a research proposal?

# Informational Interview/Coffee Chat

## Informational Interview/Coffee Chat
  - What they are:
    - Professional/Casual Networking tools
      - Potential mentors, collaborators, future job opportunities
    - Sitting down with people who have started a career
    - _Gather insights and build professional relationships_
  - Learning Opportunity
    - Someone's firsthand experience
    - challenges & successes
    - career paths
    - realistic picture of what to expect in a particular **field or role** (Not an ask, but preferrably something that we can look at)

## Setting Expectation
  - Neither should bear agenda to secure job offer
  - Learn and build connections
  - Experience informational interview as a long-term investment 
  - Start building/expanding professional network
  - The group project is a teaser of what you will likely experience going further into your career (irregardless of disciplines)

## Quick Q&A on Information interviews
  - Do you think you have a better idea of what these are by now?
  - Any questions that you may have before we dive deeper into how to design/prepare for one?

## Identify Person(s) of Intersts
  
  - Who to reach out to?
    - Industry Leaders and Role Models
    - Alumni Network
    - Professional Associations
  - Utilizing LinkedIn:
    - Advanced Sesarch Features
      - Filter professionals by industry, company, role and even location
    - LinkedIn Groups: Join groups of related interests.
  - How to narrow scope of search?
    - Finding Common Grounds
      - Shared Interests
      - Recent Publications or Talks
    - Leverage Existing Connections: Academic/Industry
  - Demo

## Crafting Effective Cold Messages

### Key Components:

  1. Subject Line: Clear and engaging subject line that conveys the purpose of the message.
  2. Personalized Greetings: Use the receipient's name and personalized remark/compliment on recent accomplishments;
  3. Introduction and Purpose: brief but effective.
  4. Purpose Statement: seek advice, insights, experiences related to field of interest;
  5. Make Connection: highlight commonalities shared with receipient
  6. Experss Genuine Intersts
  7. Specific Request: Call to Action with Flexibility
  8. Politeness and Conciseness
  9. Closing and Signature

### Let's checkout some examples. Give a probability that you will respond to a message that you receive on LinkedIn. (3 Examples)


## Reaching Out:

#### Choosing the Right Platform:

  - **Platform Etiquette**: 
    - Norms and best practices for different platforms (LinkedIn, email, professional forums)
    - Initial outreach varies accordingly
  - **Professional Channels**: 
    - using professional channels for communication is important
    - make sure your profiles on these platforms are up-to-date and professional.
      - What do we mean by _professional_?

#### Timing and Frequency:

  - **Optimal Timing**: 
    - best times to send messages: avoiding weekends, late nights, and major holidays
    - the likelihood of a timely response improves accordingly.
  - **Follow-up Strategy**: 
    - follow-up strategy involves a waiting period (typically 1-2 weeks) 
    - a polite follow-up message if there's no initial response.


## Reaching Out (Continued)

#### Managing Outreach Volume:
  - **Tracking System**: 
    - set up a simple tracking system (like a spreadsheet) to monitor whom you’ve contacted, 
    - when, and any responses or follow-up actions needed.
  - **Balanced Approach**: 
    - ideally no mass messaging. 
    - a balanced, targeted approach to outreach, 
    - focusing on quality and personalization over quantity.

## Dealing with Responses:

#### Positive Responses:
  - **Immediate Acknowledgment**: 
    - respond promptly to positive replies, 
    - expressing gratitude for the willingness to engage and 
    - proposing potential times for the chat or meeting.
  - **Preparation**: 
    - being well-prepared for the interaction, 
    - with specific questions and goals in mind.

#### Negative or No Responses:
- **Handling Rejection**: 
  - not everyone will have the time or interest to respond
  - it’s not a reflection of their worth or the quality of their outreach.
  - aka it might be very frustrating.
- **Learning from Silence**: 
  - how would a lack of response offer learning opportunities? 
  - should you change your outreach strategy or message content?


## Know Your Client (KYC)

Do your homework so that you do not make mistakes.

#### Research Basics
  
  - Background Check: reviewing linkedin profile, professional biographies, recent publications, news mentions.
    - social engineering （Searching, 2018)
  - Understanding their work: 
    - familiarize with the professional's role/projects/contributions
    - understanding the context and significance of their work

#### Contextual Undersatnding
  - Know the Industry: major trends, challenges and opportunities
  - Company Culture: culture and values of where they work/associate with for talking points

## Know Your Client (KYC) Cont'd

#### Preparing Questions: Structured/Semi-structured
  - Informed Questions: **Informed and Open-Ended**, reflecting their research and curiosity about the professional 
  - Personalized Inquiry: avoid overly general or easily Google-able questions
  - Object-Oriented: what do you want to achieve through the interviews
    - get first-hand critique on the discipline
    - know what day-to-day is like at the particular industry
  - Set an agenda: what will happen if you don't have one?


## Take 10min to social-engineer a professional
  - do research on a potential interviewee that you might be interested in investigating
  - you should cover at least the following:
    - their professional role
    - list out companies they worked for
    - their career highlight/work most proud of
    - identify interviews/podcasts/presentation where they gave public opinion and based on those
    - come up with **two questions that you think is relevant to ask**

<!-- - **Practical Exercise**: Arrange mock informational interviews where students can practice their research skills, question formulation, and conversational strategies in a supportive environment.

#### Research Presentation:
- **Group Activity**: Have students present their research findings about a professional to the group, including potential questions and conversation goals, to foster collective learning and feedback.
 -->

## Meet Your Client

#### Showing Engagement:
  - **Active Engagement**:
    - active listening, 
    - showing interest through body language (in person or on video calls), and 
    - asking follow-up questions based on the discussion.
  - **Note-taking**: 
    - taking brief notes during the conversation (with permission) to capture key points and advice,
    - demonstrates engagement and respect for the professional's insights.

#### Respect and Professionalism:
  - **Time Management**: 
    - be mindful of the agreed-upon time for the conversation and 
    - to avoid overextending unless the professional indicates they're willing to continue.
  - **Confidentiality**: 
    - the need to respect any confidential or sensitive information shared during the conversation.

## Meet Your Client (Continued)

### Post-Interaction Reflection:

#### Reflective Practice:
  - **Review and Reflect**: 
    - review their notes and reflect on the conversation soon after, 
    - identifying key learnings and any follow-up actions they might take.
  - **Feedback Loop**:
    - consider what went well and what could be improved for future interactions 
    - mindset of continuous improvement.

## Mock Interview (If we have time ~ 15min)
  
  - one-on-one practice: professional vs. student interviewer
  - work together and determine who the professional will shadow (a real person)
  - KYC on industry/persona individually
  - student interviewer to come up with 3 questions as structured interview and one follow-up during the conversation
  - student/professional to swap (if we have time)
