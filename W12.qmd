## Peer Evaluation Rubric

| # | Peer-vote item | What to listen for (0 – 5) |
|---|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | **Sharp problem statement** | Clear, focused research question that matters to designers; no rambling. |
| 2 | **Evidence integration** | Literature + data stitched together into one persuasive argument. |
| 3 | **Method & tool fit** | Qual/quant methods and any “SOTA” tools (Zotero, LLM search, etc.) are appropriate **and** briefly justified. |
| 4 | **Narrative flow & insight** | Follows a logical story arc; key findings and design implications are crystal-clear. |
| 5 | **Delivery & visuals** | Props/Slides uncluttered; presenter keeps to time, projects confidence, and engages the room. |
