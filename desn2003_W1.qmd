::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**The Strategy:**

- **User Behavior Analysis:** People love sharing personal data when it's beautifully visualized
- **Social Psychology Research:** FOMO + identity expression = virality
- **A/B Testing:** Cards vs. stories vs. videos (tested 50+ formats)

**The Result:**

- <span style="color: #1DB954; font-weight: bold;">120M+ shares</span> annually
- Became a **cultural moment** (memes, TikTok trends, news coverage)
- Competitors scrambled to copy it (Apple Music Replay, YouTube Recap)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## 🎨 Designer Takeaway

- A/B tests **EVERYTHING**: video length, sound, thumbnails, posting time
- Ethnographic insight: Gen Z consumes content differently than Millennials (no patience for intros)

**The Impact:**

- Most engaging feed in social media history
- Average user: <span style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #FE2C55;">**95 minutes/day**</span>
- Changed how ALL platforms design feeds (Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## ⚠️ Ethical Question

TikTok's research made their product **TOO** engaging. Where's the line between good UX and manipulation?

*We'll discuss research ethics throughout the semester.*
:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- Students are on TikTok—they FEEL the algorithm
- Introduce ethics early: research has consequences
- Micro-interactions matter more than demographics

## Figma: Research That Killed Sketch 🎨

[Dylan Field's story on how Figma started →](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-on-a-deadline-how-figma-built-a-product-design-team/)

**The Gap They Found (2016):**

::: {.incremental}
- Interviewed 100+ designers about workflow pain points
- **Universal complaint:** "I email design files back and forth all day"
- Insight: Design tools needed to work like **Google Docs**, not Photoshop
:::

. . .

**Research-Driven Decisions:**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
✅ Browser-based (controversial!)
✅ Real-time collaboration
✅ Free tier for network effects
✅ Comments directly on designs
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
❌ Native app (slower to build)
❌ Paid-only (limits growth)
❌ Traditional licensing
:::
:::

. . .

**The Outcome:** 0 → Industry standard in 6 years | <span style="color: #0ACF83; font-weight: bold;">$20B Adobe acquisition</span>

::: {.notes}
- Students use Figma—they get it
- They didn't build a better design tool, they researched the design PROCESS
- Show how research challenges assumptions (browser vs native)

# 💥 Epic Research Fails {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## When Designers Skip Research...

::: {.fragment}
### Juicero: The $120 Million Juice Mistake 🧃

**[Watch the infamous Bloomberg video →](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ)** | **[Full story →](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/juicero-silicon-valley-shutting-down)**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**The Product:**

- $400 WiFi-connected juicer
- Sleek design, beautiful branding
- VC funding: $120 million

**The Research They Skipped:**

- "Do people want this?"
- "Is a $400 juicer solving a real problem?"
- "Can users just... squeeze the packets by hand?"
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**The Reality:**

Bloomberg tested it: Yes, you can squeeze the packets by hand. Same juice.

**The Outcome:**

- Company shut down 16 months later
- Became a Silicon Valley punchline
:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- Show the Bloomberg video (30 seconds) - it's hilarious
- Students find this memorable—failure is entertaining
- Lesson: Research isn't just "make it pretty"

- Had to retrofit: Virtual backgrounds, touch-up appearance, "hide self-view"
- **Lesson:** Test edge cases and extreme usage
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Pattern
All of these teams had **designers**. What they lacked was **research**.
:::

# ⚡ Interactive Time {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## 🎮 Activity: Reverse Engineer Your Favorite Apps

**Pick ONE app you use daily. Discuss in pairs (3 minutes):**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. What problem does it solve?
2. What user need did they discover through research?
3. What's ONE design decision that clearly came from user testing?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Examples to Consider
**Notion** (flexibility research) | **BeReal** (authenticity fatigue) | **Duolingo** (habit loop gamification) | **Discord** (community vs. chat)
:::

::: {.notes}
- Students share out after 3 minutes
- Validate their observations
- Show how research is everywhere once you look for it

## ⚡ Lightning Round: Spot the Research

**What was researched to create these features?**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Instagram's Double-Tap to Like**
   - *Answer: Thumb reach zones, one-handed phone use*

2. **Spotify's "Made For You" Playlists**
   - *Answer: Music discovery is stressful, users want curation*

3. **Dark Mode (iOS, Twitter, Apps)**
   - *Answer: Eye strain studies, battery life data, user preference surveys*

4. **TikTok's Infinite Scroll (vs. "Are You Still Watching?")**
   - *Answer: Deliberate friction reduces engagement (they researched both!)*
:::

. . .

**Takeaway:** <span style="color: #E63946; font-weight: bold;">Every pixel can be a research decision.</span>

# 🛑 Break Time (10 Minutes) {background-color="#457B9D"}

# 🎭 Hands-On Activity {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Reverse Engineer a Persona

**Scenario:** You're redesigning Instagram for 2026

::: {.nonincremental}
**Step 1** (5 min): Pick a real person you know

- How do they ACTUALLY use Instagram right now?
- What do they complain about?
- What keeps them scrolling?

**Step 2** (5 min): Create a "Love/Hate" persona

- 3 things they **hate** about current Instagram
- 3 things they **can't live without**
- 1 feature they **wish existed**

**Step 3** (5 min): Share & find patterns

- What's common across personas?
- What surprised you?
- What would you need to research to validate these insights?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Use real people, not imaginary users
- Focus on behaviors, not demographics
- Look for patterns = research insights
- What do we NOT know? = research gaps
:::

---

## Debrief: What Did You Learn?

**Discussion questions:**

::: {.incremental}
- What assumptions did you have that turned out wrong?
- What would you research first to validate your persona?
- How would this change your design approach?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## 🎯 The Meta-Lesson

You just did **primary research** (interviewing someone) and **synthesis** (finding patterns). That's the core research loop.
:::

# 🤔 The Big Question {background-color="#F1FAEE"}

## Can Research Kill Creativity?

::: {.r-fit-text}
"If I'd asked people what they wanted, they'd say faster horses."

— Often attributed to Henry Ford
:::

. . .

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### ❌ The Myth

Ford ignored users and invented cars through genius alone
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### ✅ The Reality

Ford DID extensive research:

- Road conditions
- Driver behavior
- Manufacturing workflows
- Competitor teardowns
:::
:::

## The Research-Creativity Balance

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Here's The Truth

- **Research** tells you the **problems**
- **Design** solves them **creatively**
- **Research** validates if you **actually solved it**
:::

. . .

**Research doesn't kill creativity—it focuses it.**

::: {.incremental}
- Bad research: "What color should this button be?"
- Good research: "Why aren't users completing checkout?"
- Great research: "What's the emotional journey of buying online?"
:::

::: {.notes}
- Address the common fear: "Research will make everything boring"
- Research + creativity are partners, not enemies
- Next week we'll learn HOW to do good research
