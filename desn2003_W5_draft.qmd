# Doc 0 Feedback {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## Your Extended Abstracts: What We Saw

**The Good:**

::: {.incremental}
- Genuine curiosity about topics that matter to you
- Clear problem identification in many cases
- Personal connection to the research area
:::

. . .

**Patterns to work on:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Streamline your narratives** — Some were scattered; tighten the through-line
- **Topic vs. Question** — Several described an area without a specific inquiry
- **Scope calibration** — Some too ambitious, some too narrow for one semester
- **Theoretical framing** — Connect your problem to existing frameworks

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Today's Challenge

You have a research question. Now: **How will you answer it?**

Today we focus on **qualitative methods** — research that explores the "why" and "how" through rich, descriptive data.
:::

---

## Today's Roadmap

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Qualitative vs. Quantitative** — When to use which
2. **Interviews** — Types, design, and best practices
3. **Observations & Ethnography** — Watching behavior in context
4. **Case Studies** — Deep dives into specific instances
5. **Activity: Design Your Approach**
6. **Looking Ahead** — Doc 0.1 and connecting methods to your question
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

::: {.incremental}
1. **Distinguish** qualitative from quantitative approaches and when each is appropriate
2. **Design** an interview protocol suited to your research question
3. **Plan** observational research with clear categories and ethical considerations
4. **Select** the qualitative method(s) most appropriate for YOUR research
:::

# Qualitative vs. Quantitative {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## Two Ways of Knowing

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Qualitative

**"Why?" and "How?"**

- Explores experiences, meanings, perceptions
- Rich, descriptive data (words, images, observations)
- Smaller samples, deeper insight
- Generates hypotheses and understanding

**Typical outputs:** Themes, quotes, narratives, patterns
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Quantitative

**"How many?" and "How much?"**

- Measures frequency, magnitude, relationships
- Numerical data (counts, ratings, metrics)
- Larger samples, statistical power
- Tests hypotheses and generalizes

**Typical outputs:** Statistics, charts, percentages, correlations
:::
:::

---

## When to Use Which?

| Use Qualitative When... | Use Quantitative When... |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Exploring a new phenomenon | Testing a specific hypothesis |
| Understanding "why" behind behavior | Measuring "how much" or "how often" |
| Generating theory or hypotheses | Validating theory across populations |
| Studying complex, contextual experiences | Comparing groups or conditions |
| Sample access is limited but deep | Large sample access is available |

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## For Your Research Question
Ask yourself: Do I need to **understand depth** (qualitative) or **measure breadth** (quantitative)?

Many projects use **both** — qualitative to explore, then quantitative to validate.
:::

---

## Match the Method to the Question

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Qualitative Fits:**

- "How do users experience...?"
- "What are the barriers to...?"
- "Why do designers choose...?"
- "What meanings do people attach to...?"

*Explores, describes, understands*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Quantitative Fits:**

- "How many users prefer X over Y?"
- "Is there a correlation between...?"
- "Does intervention X increase outcome Y?"
- "What percentage of users report...?"

*Counts, compares, tests*
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Think About Your Doc 0 Question
Which type of data would help you answer it? Or do you need both?
:::

# Interviews {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Why Interviews?

Interviews let you:

::: {.incremental}
- **Access inner experiences** — thoughts, feelings, motivations
- **Explore complexity** — follow-up questions, probing
- **Hear authentic voices** — quotes, stories, language
- **Discover the unexpected** — things you didn't know to ask
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Power of Interviews
Surveys tell you *what* people do. Interviews help you understand *why*.
:::

---

## Types of Interviews

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Structured

- Fixed questions in fixed order
- Same for every participant
- Easier to compare responses
- Less flexibility

*Best for:* Systematic comparison, when you know exactly what to ask
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Semi-Structured

- Prepared questions as guide
- Flexibility to probe deeper
- Can follow interesting threads
- Balance of consistency and depth

*Best for:* Most research — structured enough to compare, flexible enough to explore
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Unstructured

- Topics but no fixed questions
- Conversational flow
- Maximum flexibility
- Harder to analyze systematically

*Best for:* Early exploration, when you don't know what to ask yet
:::
:::

---

## Designing Interview Questions

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Do:**

- Start with easy, rapport-building questions
- Use open-ended questions ("Tell me about...")
- Ask about specific experiences and examples
- Follow up: "Can you say more about that?"
- End with: "Is there anything else?"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Don't:**

- Ask leading questions ("Don't you think...?")
- Ask double-barreled questions (two questions in one)
- Ask yes/no questions (unless following up)
- Assume you know the answer
- Interrupt or rush
:::
:::

---

## Interview Question Examples

**Topic:** How students use AI tools for coursework

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Weak Questions

- "Do you like using AI?" *(yes/no)*
- "Don't you think AI is helpful?" *(leading)*
- "How do you use AI and what do you think about the ethics?" *(double-barreled)*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Strong Questions

- "Tell me about a recent time you used an AI tool for coursework."
- "Walk me through what happened."
- "What was that experience like for you?"
- "What worked well? What didn't?"
- "How did you decide when to use it or not?"
:::
:::

---

## Interview Protocol Template

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## A Basic Structure

**Opening (2 min)**
- Introduce yourself and the study
- Explain confidentiality, recording consent
- Any questions before we start?

**Warm-up (3 min)**
- Easy, non-threatening questions about background

**Core Questions (20-30 min)**
- 5-8 main questions with follow-up probes
- Move from general to specific

**Closing (2 min)**
- "Is there anything else you'd like to add?"
- Thank participant, explain next steps
:::

---

## Practical Considerations

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Logistics

- **Duration:** 30-60 min typical
- **Recording:** Ask permission, use reliable device
- **Location:** Quiet, comfortable, neutral
- **Remote:** Zoom works, test tech first
- **Notes:** Take brief notes even if recording
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Ethics

- **Informed consent:** Explain purpose, voluntary participation
- **Confidentiality:** How will you protect identity?
- **Sensitive topics:** Plan for discomfort, provide opt-out
- **Power dynamics:** Be aware of your position
- **Data storage:** Keep recordings secure
:::
:::

# Observations & Ethnography {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## Why Observe?

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Gap Between Say and Do
People often can't articulate what they do, or they report what they *think* they do rather than what they *actually* do.

Observation captures **real behavior in real contexts**.
:::

. . .

**Classic example:** Users say they read privacy policies. Observation shows they click "accept" in 2 seconds.

---

## Types of Observation

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### By Participation Level

**Participant observation**
- Researcher joins the activity
- Rich insider perspective
- May influence what you observe

**Non-participant observation**
- Researcher watches from outside
- Less intrusive
- May miss insider meanings
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### By Structure

**Structured observation**
- Predetermined categories
- Counting/timing behaviors
- Systematic, comparable

**Unstructured observation**
- Open field notes
- Capturing everything relevant
- Exploratory, flexible
:::
:::

---

## Observation in Practice

**What to observe:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Actions:** What are people doing physically?
- **Interactions:** How do they communicate? With whom?
- **Environment:** What's the space like? What tools are present?
- **Time:** How long do activities take? What sequences occur?
- **Breakdowns:** Where do things go wrong? Workarounds?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Field Notes
Write detailed notes **as soon as possible** after observing. Memory fades fast. Include:

- What happened (descriptive)
- Your interpretations (analytical)
- Questions to explore further
:::

---

## Ethnography: Extended Immersion

**Ethnography** = Extended observation in a cultural or social setting

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What makes it ethnographic:**

- Prolonged engagement (weeks, months)
- Multiple methods (observe + interview + artifacts)
- Holistic understanding of context
- Researcher reflexivity
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**In design research:**

- Spending days with users in their environment
- Understanding workflows, not just tasks
- Uncovering unspoken rules and values
- Finding design opportunities others miss
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Realistic for Your Project?
Full ethnography takes time. But **mini-ethnographies** — a few days of observation + interviews — can still yield rich insights.
:::

# Case Studies {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## What Is a Case Study?

A **case study** is an in-depth investigation of a single instance:

::: {.incremental}
- A person, group, organization, event, or phenomenon
- Uses multiple data sources (interviews, documents, observation)
- Aims for rich, contextual understanding
- Bounded in time and space
:::

. . .

**Examples:**

- How one design team adopted a new AI tool
- The redesign process of a specific app feature
- How a particular community uses a public space

---

## When to Use Case Studies

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Case studies are good for:**

- Exploring "how" and "why" questions
- Understanding complex, real-world phenomena
- When you can't separate the phenomenon from its context
- Generating rich descriptions and theories
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Limitations:**

- Limited generalizability (one case ≠ all cases)
- Time-intensive
- Researcher bias in interpretation
- Difficulty defining case boundaries
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## For Your Project
A case study approach might work if you're investigating **one specific context deeply** rather than comparing across many.
:::

---

## Case Study Data Sources

A strong case study triangulates multiple sources:

| Source Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Interviews** | Key informants, stakeholders, users |
| **Documents** | Reports, emails, meeting notes, design specs |
| **Observations** | Watching processes, attending meetings |
| **Artifacts** | Products, prototypes, physical evidence |
| **Archival records** | Usage logs, historical data |

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Triangulation
Using multiple sources increases credibility. If interviews, documents, and observations all point to the same finding, you can be more confident it's real.
:::

# Activity: Design Your Approach {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Your Task (20 minutes)

**Based on your research question from Week 4:**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Decide:** Would qualitative methods help answer your question? Why?

2. **Choose:** Which method(s) seem most appropriate?
   - Interviews? What type? Who would you interview?
   - Observations? Where? What would you look for?
   - Case study? What's the case?

3. **Draft:** Create ONE of the following:
   - 3-5 interview questions you might ask
   - An observation plan (where, what to look for)
   - A case definition (what's the bounded case?)

4. **Consider:** What are the limitations of your chosen approach?
:::

---

## Discuss in Pairs (10 minutes)

**Share with a neighbor:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- What method did you choose and why?
- What did you draft?
- What concerns or challenges do you anticipate?
:::

. . .

**Give feedback:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Does the method seem to fit the question?
- Are the interview questions open-ended enough?
- Is the observation plan specific enough to be actionable?
:::

---

## Debrief

::: {.incremental}
- Who chose interviews? What made that seem right for your question?
- Who chose observation? What would you observe?
- Who's considering a case study approach?
- What challenges came up in designing your approach?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Remember
Your method choice isn't final yet. Doc 0.1 (Literature Review) will help you see what methods others have used for similar questions — which might refine your approach.

# Key Takeaways {background-color="#457B9D"}

## What We Learned Today

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Qualitative research** explores the "why" and "how" through rich, descriptive data — complementing quantitative "how much"

2. **Interviews** access inner experiences; semi-structured interviews balance consistency with flexibility

3. **Observations** capture real behavior in context — what people do, not just what they say

4. **Case studies** provide deep understanding of bounded instances using multiple data sources

5. **Method choice follows question** — let your research question guide which approach fits best

6. **Triangulation strengthens findings** — multiple sources pointing to the same conclusion increases credibility
