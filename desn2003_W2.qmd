## Roadmap/Overview of Session

- How can research be classified
- Any particular types of methodologies that are involved
- What is Research Gap and how do you identify it?

# Classification of research

## Types of Research: Classification & Definition
- **Applied vs. Fundamental**
  - Basic (Fundamental) Research
    - Expanding knowledge without immediate practical application
  - Applied Research
    - Solving specific, real-world problems
- **Quantitative & Qualitative**
  - Quantitative Research
    - Using numbers and statistics to analyze data
  - Qualitative Research
    - Exploring non-numerical data like text, interviews, or observations
  - Mixed Methods Research
    - Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches
- Others types you might come across
  - Descriptive Research
    - Describing characteristics of a phenomenon or population
  - Exploratory Research: Investigating a problem that hasn't been clearly defined
  - Experimental Research: Manipulating variables to test cause-and-effect relationships

## Why classification of research?

- Choosing the appropriate method for research question/problem
- Provide common langugage across different fields to discuss and compare methodologies
- Distinguish between `fads` and `long-term trends`

# Research methodology

## Quantitative Methods
- **Causal Comparative**: 
  - Investigates cause-and-eﬀect relationships by comparing two or more groups based on a pre-existing criterion.
- **Correlation Based**: 
  - Examines the relationship and degree of association between two or more variables.
- **Data Mining and Analytics**: 
  - Involves extracting and analyzing large datasets to discover patterns, trends, and relationships.
- **Experimental**: 
  - Employs controlled testing to determine the causal eﬀect of an intervention or treatment.
- **Non-experimental**: 
  - Observes and measures variables without manipulating them, often used in naturalistic settings.

## Quantitative Methods (Cont'd)

- **Longitudinal Analysis**: 
  - Studies the same variables over an **extended period** to observe changes and developments.
- **Meta-Analysis**: 
  - **Combines results from multiple studies** to arrive at a comprehensive conclusion on a particular topic.
- **Random Controlled Trials (RCTs)**: 
  - Randomly assigns participants to a **treatment or control group** to evaluate the eﬀect of an intervention.
- **Quasi-experimental**: 
  - Resembles experimental design but lacks random assignment, o#en used when controlled experiments are not feasible.
- **Survey**: 
  - Collects data from a sample of individuals through questionnaires or interviews to generalize findings to a larger population.


# A quick side-note: Introduction to AB Testing

**AB Testing: The Scientific Approach to Design Decisions**

- **Definition**: A method to compare two versions of a variable to determine which performs better
- **Origin**: Derived from *Randomized Controlled Trials* (RCTs) in scientific research
- **Application**: Widely used in *product development*, *marketing*, and *user experience design*

::: {.notes}
AB testing brings scientific rigor to design and product decisions, allowing data-driven choices.
:::

## Key Concepts

1. **Control Group**: The existing version (A)
2. **Treatment Group**: The new version being tested (B)
3. **Randomization**: Users randomly assigned to A or B
4. **Metrics**: Predefined measures of success
5. **Statistical Significance**: Ensuring results aren't due to chance

::: {.callout-tip}
## Remember
The only difference between A and B should be the element you're testing!
:::

## The AB Testing Process

1. <span style="color: #4CAF50;">**Hypothesis**</span>: Formulate a testable prediction
2. <span style="color: #2196F3;">**Design**</span>: Create version A and B
3. <span style="color: #FFC107;">**Implement**</span>: Set up the test environment
4. <span style="color: #9C27B0;">**Collect Data**</span>: Run the test and gather results
5. <span style="color: #F44336;">**Analyze**</span>: Determine statistical significance
6. <span style="color: #795548;">**Conclude**</span>: Make data-driven decisions

## Case Study - Button Color Test

**Hypothesis**: *A green "Learn More" button will increase conversions compared to the current blue button.*

**Results**:

- Version A (Blue): 100 sign-ups from 1000 views (10% conversion)
- Version B (Green): 150 sign-ups from 1000 views (15% conversion)
- *50% increase* in conversion rate, statistically significant (p < 0.05)

## Best Practices and Conclusions

**Best Practices**:

- Test one variable at a time
- Ensure sufficient sample size
- Run tests long enough for statistical significance
- Consider seasonal effects and external factors

**Conclusions**:

- AB testing provides *data-driven insights* for design decisions
- It reduces guesswork and potential costly mistakes
- Continuous testing leads to ongoing optimization

::: {.notes}
AB testing is a powerful tool, but it's important to use it wisely and in conjunction with other research methods.

# Research Gap

## Defining a Research Gap
- A research gap is an area where <span style="color:red">**no or little information is available**</span>
- It represents an opportunity for new research and discovery
- Comes in diﬀerent flavors:
  - Concept or new idea that hasn’t been studied at all
  - All existing research are outdated and in need for new/updated research
  - Specific population has not been well studied

## Methods to Identify Research Gaps
- Systematic literature review
  - “suggestions for future research” or conclusion section
- Find and read heavily-cited seminal works
- Use databases like Web of Science, SAGE, Research Rabbit etc.
- Consultation with experts in the field
- Analyzing current trends and future projections

## Importance of Identifying Gaps for Innovation
- Drives the research agenda towards areas of high impact
- Helps in allocating resources eﬀectively
- Encourages exploration of under-researched areas

# Let's test out our understanding of some of these concepts

## Exercising identificaiton of Research Gap - Abstract One

*Find the actual research gap sentence FIRST. Find the ACTUAL research gap between the three after.*

> From "Inclusive Voice Assistants: Exploring Designs for Visual and Motor Impairments" (Brewer et al., 2021, CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems):

> "Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are increasingly prevalent in smart home devices, yet their accessibility for users with visual and motor impairments remains understudied. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 16 participants with visual or motor impairments to understand their experiences with VUIs. Our findings reveal that while VUIs offer benefits for hands-free interaction, they often lack adequate feedback mechanisms for users with visual impairments and fail to accommodate the speech patterns of some users with motor impairments. We propose design recommendations for more inclusive VUIs, including customizable feedback options and adaptive speech recognition."

## Exercising identificaiton of Research Gap - Abstract Two

*Find the actual research gap sentence FIRST. Find the ACTUAL research gap between the three after.*

> From "Designing Voice Interfaces for Older Adults: A Systematic Literature Review" (Chen et al., 2020, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction):

> "This systematic review synthesizes research on voice user interfaces (VUIs) for older adults. We analyzed 45 papers published between 2010 and 2020, focusing on design considerations, user experiences, and challenges. Our findings indicate that while VUIs can enhance independence for older adults, current designs often do not adequately address age-related changes in cognition, hearing, and speech production. Moreover, privacy concerns and technology acceptance remain significant barriers to VUI adoption among this population. We identify key research gaps and provide a roadmap for future work in designing age-friendly VUIs."

## Exercising identificaiton of Research Gap - Abstract Three

*Find the actual research gap sentence FIRST. Find the ACTUAL research gap between the three after.*

> From "Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Voice User Interface Design" (Kim & Martinez, 2022, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction):

> "Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are becoming global products, yet their design often reflects Western cultural norms. This study examines VUI preferences across three cultures: American, Korean, and Brazilian. Through surveys (n=300) and interviews (n=30), we found significant differences in command phrasing, error recovery strategies, and personification preferences. However, current VUI design frameworks do not adequately account for these cultural variations, potentially leading to reduced usability and user satisfaction in non-Western contexts. We propose a culturally adaptive VUI design model and highlight areas for future cross-cultural VUI research."
