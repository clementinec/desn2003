# Introducting Data before its Collection

## Types of Research Data Collection (Source)

- Primary Data Source
  - 1st hand information
  - not changed by any individual
  - not published yet
  - **directly collected by authors**
- Secondary Source
  - published data
  - what literature review is based on
  - **reviewed by authors(you)**

## Examples of data collection methods by category

- Primary Data Collection Examples
  - Questionnaires
  - Interviews
  - Focus Group Interviews
  - Observation
    - participant/non-participant
    - aware/non-aware
  - Survey
  - Statistical Methods
  - Experimental Methods
- Secondary Data Collection Examples
  - Published Papers/Sources
  - Databases
  - Books
  - General websites
  - Unpulibhsed personal records
  - Census data/population statistics

## Primary Data Collection Methods: Desining Questionnaires
- a set of questions and secure answers from respondants
- often analyzed by statsitical methods
- consistency in questionnaires make cross-sectional analysis easy

### Types of questions designed to measure variables in survey:
- Close-end questions
  1. Two-option aka dichotomous scales
  2. More than two options: Nominal-polychromous
  3. Ordinal-Polytomous scale
  4. Continous or bounded types
- Open-end questions
  - setence completion
  - open-ended questions with free text responses

## Polytomous Variables, aka Options for Multiple Choice Questions
Statistical term that refers to a **categorical** variable with more than two possible categories or levels

##### Common in: Survey research ,healthcare, market research and education

### Characteristics:
- Categorical data: limited/distinct values or categories that are **mutually exclusive**
- Always more than two options(binary)
- Ordered and unordered (natural hiearchy)
- Statistical analyses: e.g. logistic regression, cluster analysis for patterns and trends
- Convertable to binary variables

### Purpose:
- Understanding complex phenomena: patterns and trends in the data collected
- Provide insights to better categorization of data
- Statistical analyses: Relationships between variables: e.g. logistic regression to predict probability
- Market segmentation: e.g. customers to preference, behavior, demographic groups

## Polytomous Variable (Continued)

### When to use Polytomous Variables
- Measuring attitudes or perceptions: for more nuanced perceptions
- Putting definitions on categorizzing data: greater variability
- Analyzing relationships between variables: job satisfication & job performance
- Need to capture complex phenomena

### Limitations
- Power of explanation limited by available options
  - e.g. satisfactory survey & number of enrolled students, what about change?
- **subjectivity** from questionnaire design and interpretation of results
- **response bias** 
- small **sample sizes**
  - calculating the appropriate size of population needed
  - amount of respondants needed to reach statistical significance (reject null hypothesis, not covered by current class, leverage sample size calculator online)

## Primary Data Collection: Designing Questionnaires

Face-to-face, paper-and-pencil or remote, make sure your data collected is:
- well-organized and 
- easily accessible for analysis.


### General rules for constructing a questionnaire:

**Dos:**

- questions should be short and simple
- provide clear navigation to avoid difficulty in reading and motivate answering
- use positive sentences
- add open-answer possibility after provideing listed answers
- improve reliability by selecting appropriate words
- explain importance of the questionnaire
- order your questions to solicit the right answers (sensitive to follow concrete/innocuous ones)

**Do-nots:**

- use more than one question (double-barreled) in one item
- make assumptions for the respondents
- lead the respondant to answers with clues, suggestions and hints

## Steps involved in designing a questionnaire

![](data/questionnaire_steps.png)


## Primary Data Collection: Interviews
Face-to-face and remote (telephone/zoom) interviews and merit/demerits (Kabir, 2016).

![](data/interview_types.png)

Good for complex or sensitive concepts and need detailed and high-status information (Frechtling, 2020).

### Types of interviews by structure:
- structured interviews: standardized questions that are pre-prepared
- semi-structured interviews: conducted based on guide but goes beyond list of questions
- unstructured interviews: _informal_, casual conversations

## Rundown of an interview process
![](data/interview_process.png)


## Primary Data Collection: Focus Group Discussion (FGD)
- Mixture of interview and observation
- Used to discover human behavior, attitudes and respondents facing a particular concept
- 6-12 people in each group with shared characteristics
- Mediator aims to stimulate and discover the behavior of the participats and reasons for each behavior using the social dynamic of the group

![](data/FGD.png)

## FGD: Strengths and Weaknesses
#### Strengths:
  - discover social, health and cultural concepts
  - literacy of individuals non-issue
  - suitable to explore complex subjects
  - useful to develop hypotheses

#### Weaknesses:
  - expensive and time-consuming
  - privacy risks
  - confined by readiness of facilitator/mediator
  - domination of limited individuals in focus group (Frechtling, 2002, Kabir, 2016)

## Survey and questionnaire: What's the difference?

- Questionnaire is the written set of questions.
- Survey is both the set of questions and the process of collecting, aggregating and analyzing the responses from those questions.

## Good & Bad Survey Questions: Let's try out how to conduct surveys
Context: Surveying respondants on their religious beliefs and life styles

1. How religious are you?
  - vague, not sure what is being asked
  - How would you rate your level of spirituality? Pick a value between 0 to 4
2. What do you think about smoking on campus?
  - vague, too many possible answers
  - Do you believe that all buildings on campus should be designated as smoke-free?
3. How important is spirituality in your life? Pick a value between 1(not at all) to 5 (Very much so), (3: somewhat important).
  - leading, suggests that spirituality is important
  - What role does spirituality play in your life? Pick between 1(not important) to 5(very important) with 3 being somewhat important


## Recap: Tips for effective surveys:
1. Avoid ambiguity
2. Avoid leading questions
3. Avoid lengthy surveys and very long responses
4. How will your initial questions influence answers to subsequent ones?
5. Think carefully about sampling techniques
6. Seek to achieve highest rate possible
7. Standardize administration procedures
8. Guarantee anonymity (or confidentiality at minimum)
9. Seek measures of reliability
10. Assess validity.

## Primary Data Collection: Case Studies

- Opportunity to investigate issues deeply and descriptively. 
- technically not a research method
- combination of various methods to form proper understanding of the proposed case:
  - gather data through qualitative methods including interviews and surveys
  - acquire secondary-sourced data e.g. essays and diaries for analysis
  - personally provided notes can be also utilized alongside official ones

![](data/case_study.png)


## Information Sources for Case Studies

- Direct observation from subjective evaluations
  - Single or group of observers
- Participant observation
  - Researcher participate in the setting like other under-study people and observe happenings from a closer perspective
- Conduct interviews with survey-type questions that are structured based on more open-ended question sets.
- Use various census and survey records, newspapers, letters, instruments, tools, etc.

## Merit and Challenges of working with Case Studies

### Pros/Merits:
- Combines the strengths of multiple research methods
- Consider research from various time frame: past, present and future
- Provide explanation about the changes and impacting factors that are not readily available

### Cons/Challenges:
- Complex processes, time consuming and expensive
- No clear limit on when to stop collecting data
- The assumption taken may not always be realistic or data tested in that context
- Usually requires expert and trained conducting teams
- Over-interpretation and over-generalizing issues can happen (Taherdoost, 2021)

## Primary Data Collection: Experimental

1. Laboratory/Controlled: 
    - Highest control over study design and process, 
    - gain precise and accurate data
2. Field: 
    - real-life situation, 
    - variables are manipulated still but 
    - your control is lower than Scenario 1
3. Natural experiment: 
    - no control over variables/environmental setting
    - very low reproducibility


## Secondary dcata collection methods

**Data gathered from published sources.**

![](data/secondary_data.png)

## Challenges of Data Collection Process

1. Location of data collection

    - neutral location
    - participants to feel free to provide their responses

2. Literacy of Participants and Langauge of Questions

    - Design of questions is appropriate for the literacy level of participants
    - may require pilot tests to confirm (added costs)

3. Timing

    - Duration of test needs to be long enough to yield reasonable results
    - Short enough to maintain the engagement of the participants

4. Sensitivity of Data

    - Privacy of the Participants (Unique identifier)
    - Protecting personal information through promises and icebreakers and examples


## Let's practice data collection/design concepts


>_Several years ago, a group of students at University of Central Arkansas conducted a study in which they observed the rate at which cars failed to stop at a campus stop sign and recorded whether the car had a student parking decal or a faculty/staff parking decal._ This is obviously not fitting for Hong Kong context. Let's perhaps picture a study of the **rate of jay-walking at a traffic light** instead - and record whether the pedestrian who crossed is a student/staff/tourist/local resident. 
>Use what we have covered today to answer questions 1-7:


1. Which method of observation would be best? Justify your answer. Hint: back to participant/direct observations.
2. How would you schedule observations?
3. Define the categories of behavior that you would observe
4. Describe how you would optimize and measure the reliability of observations, including the use of independent observers and calculation of interobserver agreement.
5. Describe how you could use equipment for observation rather than human observers, what are the advantages and disadvantages?
6. Describe how you might use public records to answer the same research question. What might be some limitations of this approach
7. Describe how you might use a survey method to answer the same research question. What might be some limitations of this approach?
