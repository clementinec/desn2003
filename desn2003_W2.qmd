# Picking Up Where We Left Off {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## Last Week: Your Instagram Feature Ideas

Remember the persona exercise?

::: {.nonincremental}
- You picked someone you know
- Identified what they **love** and **hate** about Instagram
- Proposed a **new feature** Instagram is "dying for"
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Today's Big Question

How do you know your feature idea is **actually needed**—and not just a clever assumption?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Quick recall to activate prior knowledge
- Set up the tension: intuition vs. evidence
- This frames the whole session
:::

---

## Quick Pulse Check

**Turn to a neighbor (2 minutes):**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. What feature did you propose last week?
2. What made you think Instagram *needs* this?
:::

. . .

We'll come back to these ideas throughout today's session.

# Case Study: Validating Your Feature {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## The Challenge

You've identified a gap. Now let's stress-test it.

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Your Task (15 minutes, in pairs)

Pick ONE of your feature ideas and work through these questions:
:::

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **The Gap:** What specific user problem or frustration does this feature solve?
2. **The Evidence:** What makes you believe this gap exists? (Personal experience? Observations? Something you read?)
3. **The Assumption Check:** Could this just be *your* preference, or is it widespread?
4. **The Landscape:** Does this feature exist in a competitor app (TikTok, BeReal, Snapchat)? If yes, why might Instagram not have it? If no, why might that be?
5. **The Validation:** If you had to prove this gap is real, what would you do?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Circulate and listen to conversations
- Note interesting approaches to bring up in debrief
- Push them: "How do you KNOW that's true?"
:::

---

## Debrief: What Did You Discover?

**Let's hear from a few groups:**

::: {.incremental}
- What gap did you identify?
- How confident are you that it's real?
- What would you need to validate it?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Notice Something?

You just did **research thinking**—without formal methods. Now let's name what you were doing.
:::

# The Research You Already Did {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## Planting Seeds: Methods You Used Without Knowing

When you worked through that case study, you were already doing research:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What You Did:**

- Recalled how someone uses Instagram
- Noticed their frustrations
- Compared to your own experience
- Thought about "would others feel this way?"
- Imagined how to test your idea
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Formal Name:**

- **Ethnographic observation** (watching behavior)
- **Pain point analysis** (identifying friction)
- **Comparative analysis** (self vs. others)
- **Generalizability question** (sample → population)
- **Research design thinking** (validation strategy)
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Point
Research isn't something foreign—it's **systematic thinking** you already do naturally. Today we formalize it.
:::

---

## The Validation Methods You Proposed

When asked "how would you prove this gap is real?", you likely suggested:

::: {.incremental}
- **"Ask more people"** → That's a **survey** or **interview**
- **"Watch how people actually use it"** → That's **observational research** or **usability testing**
- **"Look at app reviews/complaints"** → That's **secondary research** / **content analysis**
- **"Check if competitors have this feature"** → That's **competitive analysis**
- **"Test it with a small group"** → That's **prototype testing** or **A/B testing**
:::

. . .

These are all legitimate research methodologies. The question is: **which one fits your question?**

# Why Research Frameworks Matter {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## From Gut Feeling to Systematic Inquiry

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Without Frameworks

- "I think users want this"
- "My friend complained about it"
- "It makes sense to me"
- "I've seen people struggle"

**Problem:** Confirmation bias, small samples, untested assumptions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### With Frameworks

- "User interviews revealed a pattern"
- "Survey data shows 67% experience this"
- "Competitive analysis found a gap"
- "A/B test showed 40% improvement"

**Strength:** Systematic, defensible, scalable
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Shift
Research frameworks don't replace intuition—they **validate and strengthen** it.
:::

# Classification of Research {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## The Big Picture: Types of Research

**Applied vs. Fundamental**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Basic (Fundamental) Research

- Expanding knowledge without immediate practical application
- "How do humans process visual information?"
- Builds theory and understanding

*Your Instagram work:* Not this (you have a practical goal)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Applied Research

- Solving specific, real-world problems
- "How can we reduce checkout abandonment?"
- Directly informs design decisions

*Your Instagram work:* **This one!** You're solving a real user problem.
:::
:::

---

## Quantitative vs. Qualitative

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Quantitative Research

- Numbers and statistics
- "How many users experience this?"
- "What's the conversion rate?"
- Measures **magnitude** and **frequency**

**Your case study:** "Would others feel this way?" → needs quantitative validation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Qualitative Research

- Non-numerical data (text, interviews, observations)
- "Why do users feel frustrated?"
- "How do they describe the problem?"
- Explores **depth** and **meaning**

**Your case study:** Understanding the persona's frustrations → qualitative insight
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Mixed Methods
Often the most powerful approach: **Qualitative** to understand the "why" → **Quantitative** to measure the "how many"
:::

---

## Why Classification Matters

::: {.incremental}
- **Choosing the right method** for your research question
- **Common language** to discuss and compare approaches
- **Distinguish fads from real trends** (is this a genuine gap or a passing complaint?)
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Back to Your Feature Idea

If you want to validate your Instagram feature:

- **Qualitative first:** Interview 5-10 users to understand the problem deeply
- **Quantitative second:** Survey 100+ users to see if the pattern holds broadly
:::

# Research Gap: The Heart of Innovation {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## What Is a Research Gap?

A research gap is an area where **no or little information is available**

::: {.incremental}
- It represents an opportunity for new research and discovery
- It's where innovation lives
:::

. . .

**Types of gaps:**

::: {.incremental}
- A concept or idea that **hasn't been studied at all**
- Existing research is **outdated** and needs updating
- A **specific population** hasn't been well studied
- A **context** hasn't been explored (e.g., Instagram for Gen Z creators vs. casual users)
:::

::: {.notes}
- Connect directly to their case study: "The gap you identified in Instagram? That's a research gap."
:::

---

## Your Instagram Feature = A Research Gap Hypothesis

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Think About It

When you proposed your feature, you were essentially saying:

*"There's a gap between what users need and what Instagram currently offers."*
:::

. . .

**But is it a real gap?**

::: {.incremental}
- Maybe Instagram already tried it and it failed (you don't know the history)
- Maybe only a small subset of users want it (your sample is biased)
- Maybe there's a technical/business reason it doesn't exist
- Maybe it exists and you just haven't found it
:::

. . .

**Research helps you answer:** Is this gap real, significant, and addressable?

## Methods to Identify & Validate Research Gaps

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**For Academic Research:**

- Systematic literature review
- "Suggestions for future research" sections
- Heavily-cited seminal works
- Databases: Web of Science, SAGE, Research Rabbit
- Consultation with experts
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**For Product/Design Research:**

- User interviews & pain point analysis
- App store reviews & social media complaints
- Competitive analysis
- Usage analytics & drop-off data
- Customer support ticket patterns
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## The Parallel
Academic researchers read papers to find gaps. Product researchers talk to users and analyze data. **Same goal, different sources.**
:::

# A Quick Side-Note: A/B Testing {background-color="#457B9D"}

## The Scientific Approach to Design Decisions

**A/B Testing:** A method to compare two versions of a variable to determine which performs better

::: {.incremental}
- **Origin:** Derived from *Randomized Controlled Trials* (RCTs) in scientific research
- **Application:** Widely used in *product development*, *marketing*, and *user experience design*
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Connection to Your Case Study
If your Instagram feature got built, A/B testing would be how they'd validate it actually works better than the current design.
:::

---

## Key Concepts

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Control Group:** The existing version (A)
2. **Treatment Group:** The new version being tested (B)
3. **Randomization:** Users randomly assigned to A or B
4. **Metrics:** Predefined measures of success
5. **Statistical Significance:** Ensuring results aren't due to chance
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Remember
The only difference between A and B should be the element you're testing!
:::

---

## The A/B Testing Process

::: {.nonincremental}
1. <span style="color: #4CAF50;">**Hypothesis**</span>: Formulate a testable prediction
2. <span style="color: #2196F3;">**Design**</span>: Create version A and B
3. <span style="color: #FFC107;">**Implement**</span>: Set up the test environment
4. <span style="color: #9C27B0;">**Collect Data**</span>: Run the test and gather results
5. <span style="color: #F44336;">**Analyze**</span>: Determine statistical significance
6. <span style="color: #795548;">**Conclude**</span>: Make data-driven decisions

## Case Study - Button Color Test

**Hypothesis**: *A green "Learn More" button will increase conversions compared to the current blue button.*

**Results**:

- Version A (Blue): 100 sign-ups from 1000 views (10% conversion)
- Version B (Green): 150 sign-ups from 1000 views (15% conversion)
- *50% increase* in conversion rate, statistically significant (p < 0.05)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Your Feature Idea
How would you A/B test it? What would "success" look like in metrics?
:::

# Research Methodologies: A Toolkit {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## Quantitative Methods (The Numbers)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Measuring & Comparing:**

- **Survey:** Collect data from many users
- **Experimental:** Test cause-and-effect
- **A/B Testing (RCTs):** Compare two versions
- **Correlation:** Find relationships between variables
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Analyzing Patterns:**

- **Data Mining & Analytics:** Discover patterns in large datasets
- **Longitudinal Analysis:** Track changes over time
- **Meta-Analysis:** Combine results from multiple studies
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## For Your Instagram Feature
Survey could validate how widespread the problem is. A/B testing could measure if your solution works.
:::

---

## Qualitative Methods (The Why)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Understanding People:**

- **Interviews:** Deep conversations with users
- **Ethnography:** Immerse in user's environment
- **Case Study:** In-depth analysis of specific situation
- **Phenomenology:** Understand lived experiences
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Analyzing Content:**

- **Content Analysis:** Systematically analyze text/media
- **Grounded Theory:** Build theory from data
- **Narrative Analysis:** Explore personal stories
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## For Your Instagram Feature
Interviews would help you understand WHY users are frustrated. Ethnography could reveal how they actually use the app (vs. how they say they do).
:::

---

## Mixed Methods: Best of Both Worlds

When you need both **depth** (qualitative) and **scale** (quantitative):

::: {.incremental}
- **Sequential Explanatory:** Quantitative first, then qualitative to explain
- **Sequential Exploratory:** Qualitative first, then quantitative to validate
- **Concurrent Triangulation:** Both at once, compare results
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Instagram Approach
1. **Qualitative:** Interview 10 users about their frustrations (find patterns)
2. **Quantitative:** Survey 500 users to see if patterns hold (validate scale)
3. **Experimental:** A/B test the feature with a subset (measure impact)
:::

# Applying the Frameworks {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## Exercise: Classify Your Research Approach

**Return to your Instagram feature idea (5 minutes):**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. Is validating your feature **applied** or **fundamental** research?
2. Would you start with **qualitative** or **quantitative** methods? Why?
3. What specific method would you use first?
4. How would you know if the gap is real vs. assumed?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Share Out
Be ready to explain your reasoning to the class.

## Scenarios: What Type of Research?

> What type of research is this and why?

::: {.incremental}
1. A team conducts **eye-tracking studies** to understand how users interact with a new stories feature.
   - *Applied, Quantitative, Experimental/Observational*

2. A UX researcher analyzes the **evolution of navigation patterns** in mobile apps over the past decade.
   - *Applied, Mixed Methods, Longitudinal/Content Analysis*

3. A startup runs **A/B tests** on their e-commerce checkout process.
   - *Applied, Quantitative, Experimental (RCT)*
:::

## Research Gap Practice: VUI Abstracts

*Find the research gap sentence, then identify the actual gap:*

> **Abstract 1:** "Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are increasingly prevalent in smart home devices, yet **their accessibility for users with visual and motor impairments remains understudied**. We conducted a mixed-methods study..."

> **Abstract 2:** "Our findings indicate that while VUIs can enhance independence for older adults, **current designs often do not adequately address age-related changes** in cognition, hearing, and speech production..."

> **Abstract 3:** "However, **current VUI design frameworks do not adequately account for these cultural variations**, potentially leading to reduced usability..."

. . .

**Overarching gap:** VUI design lacks consideration for diverse user populations (accessibility, age, culture)

# Wrap-Up {background-color="#457B9D"}

## Today's Key Takeaways

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Research thinking is natural**—you already do it. Frameworks make it systematic.
2. **Research gaps are opportunities**—your feature idea is a hypothesis about a gap.
3. **Applied vs. Fundamental** tells you the goal; **Quant vs. Qual** tells you the approach.
4. **Start qualitative** to understand the "why," then go **quantitative** to measure the "how many."
5. **Validation transforms assumptions into insights**—that's the power of research.
:::

## The Bridge: From Instinct to Evidence

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Week 1:** You had an instinct

- "Instagram needs this feature"
- Based on observing someone you know
- A hypothesis waiting to be tested
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Week 2:** You learned to validate it

- Is this a real research gap?
- What methods would test it?
- How do you move from assumption to evidence?
:::
:::

. . .

**Next Week:** We'll dive into **Literature Review**—how to find what's already known so you don't reinvent the wheel.

---

## The Question We're Leaving Open

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Think About This Before Next Week

When you checked "does this exist in a competitor app?"—how thorough was that search?

- Did you check all competitors, or just the ones you know?
- Did you look at academic research on similar features?
- Did you find out if Instagram tried this before and it failed?
- Do you know what the *state of the art* is in this space?
:::

. . .

**The uncomfortable truth:** Your "gap" might not be a gap at all—you just haven't looked hard enough yet.

. . .

**Next week:** How to *systematically* map what's already known—so your innovation is actually new.

# Doc 0: Your Extended Abstract {background-color="#457B9D"}

## What Is an Extended Abstract?

An extended abstract is **not** a summary of a paper you haven't written yet.

It's a **pitch for your research**:

::: {.incremental}
- What problem are you investigating?
- Why does it matter (to you, to the field, to the world)?
- What's your angle or approach?
- What might you find or contribute?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Think of It As...
A movie trailer for your research. You're convincing someone it's worth watching—without spoiling the ending (because you don't know it yet).
:::

---

## Extended Abstract: The Structure

**≤500 words. Plain text. No citations needed.**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What to include:**

1. **The Problem** (2-3 sentences)
   - What issue are you investigating?

2. **Why It Matters** (2-3 sentences)
   - Personal significance + broader relevance

3. **The Gap** (1-2 sentences)
   - What's missing or understudied?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
4. **Your Approach** (2-3 sentences)
   - How will you investigate this?

5. **Potential Contribution** (1-2 sentences)
   - What might we learn?

6. **Next Steps** (optional)
   - Bullet points on what you'll do next
:::
:::

---

## What Makes a Strong Extended Abstract?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Do this:**

- Be specific about the problem
- Show genuine curiosity
- Scope appropriately (not too broad, not too narrow)
- Connect personal interest to broader significance
- Be honest about what you don't know yet
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Avoid this:**

- Vague topics ("I want to study sustainability")
- Just describing *what* without *why*
- Overpromising results you can't deliver
- Trying to sound "academic" at the expense of clarity
- Including citations (save those for Doc 0.1)
:::
:::

---

## Example: From Instagram Feature to Extended Abstract

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Your Instagram idea could become Doc 0

**Feature idea:** "A 'slow feed' mode that limits scrolling to reduce anxiety"

**Extended abstract seed:**

*Social media platforms optimize for engagement, often at the expense of user wellbeing. Instagram users report feeling anxious after extended scrolling sessions, yet the app provides no built-in tools to moderate consumption. This creates a gap between user needs (mindful usage) and platform design (maximized engagement). I propose to investigate how design interventions—specifically, intentional friction like scroll limits or "slow feed" modes—might reduce user anxiety without eliminating engagement entirely. Through user interviews and prototype testing, this research could contribute design principles for ethical engagement features...*
:::

---

## Your Task: Doc 0 Due Week 4

**For the next two weeks:**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. Choose a topic you're genuinely curious about
2. Draft your extended abstract (≤500 words)
3. Use the structure: Problem → Significance → Gap → Approach → Contribution
4. Submit by **Tuesday, Feb 10, 12:00 PM noon**
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Starting Point
Your Instagram feature idea could be the seed—or pivot to something else entirely. What matters is that YOU find it interesting.
