# Research to Decision Canvas — Worked Example

**Your Name:** Alex Chen **Date:** Week 9

**Product/Feature Idea:** Hide Instagram like counts from public view (users can still see their own)

---

## 1. Scientific Foundation

| Source | Key Finding | Mechanism |
|:-------|:------------|:----------|
| Festinger (1954) | Social comparison theory — people evaluate themselves by comparing to others | Visible likes enable comparison → comparison triggers anxiety |
| Vogel et al. (2014) | Facebook social comparison linked to lower self-esteem | Upward comparison (to "better" performers) is particularly harmful |
| Verduyn et al. (2017) | Passive social media use (scrolling, comparing) → negative well-being | Active use (posting, commenting) is less harmful than passive comparison |

**One-sentence summary:** Research suggests that visible engagement metrics enable social comparison, which drives anxiety and lower self-esteem, particularly among young users.

---

## 2. Your Primary Data

| Method | Key Finding | Strength of Evidence |
|:-------|:------------|:---------------------|
| 12 interviews | 9/12 participants explicitly mentioned comparing likes to friends; described as "automatic" | [x] Strong [ ] Moderate [ ] Weak |
| 127 survey responses | 67% selected "comparing to others" as motivation for checking likes | [x] Strong [ ] Moderate [ ] Weak |
| Diary study (8 participants) | Comparison behavior highest immediately after posting | [ ] Strong [x] Moderate [ ] Weak |

**Pattern summary:** Our data shows that comparison is a primary driver of like-checking behavior, and users are aware this comparison harms them but feel unable to stop.

---

## 3. Product Hypothesis

**If we build** a feature that hides like counts from viewers (only the poster sees their own counts)

**then** users will experience less comparison-driven anxiety and report higher well-being

**because** removing visible metrics eliminates the primary trigger for social comparison (you can't compare if you can't see)

---

## 4. Expected Effect

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target After Launch |
|:-------|:-----------------|:--------------------|
| % reporting "I check to compare" | 67% | <40% |
| Average GAD-7 anxiety score | 8.4 (moderate) | <7.0 (mild) |
| Like-checking frequency | 4.2x/day | <3.0x/day |

**How confident are you?** [ ] High [x] Medium (directional evidence) [ ] Low

---

## 5. Success Metrics

| Metric Type | What You'll Measure | How You'll Measure It |
|:------------|:--------------------|:----------------------|
| **Primary** | Self-reported comparison frequency | Pre/post survey question |
| **Secondary** | Anxiety levels (GAD-7) | Validated scale at baseline and 4 weeks |
| **Qualitative** | User sentiment about the change | 10 exit interviews |

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|
| Users feel less validated, post less | [x] High [ ] Med [ ] Low | [ ] High [x] Med [ ] Low | Users still see their own likes; focus messaging on privacy |
| Creators/influencers revolt (need public validation) | [x] High [ ] Med [ ] Low | [x] High [ ] Med [ ] Low | Optional toggle for creator accounts |
| Engagement metrics drop, affecting ad revenue | [ ] High [x] Med [ ] Low | [x] High [ ] Med [ ] Low | Monitor closely; prepare rollback plan |

---

## 7. Validation Plan

| Phase | Method | Sample Size | Duration | Decision Criteria |
|:------|:-------|:------------|:---------|:------------------|
| Phase 1 | A/B test (hidden vs. visible) | 10,000 users | 4 weeks | Comparison reports <50% AND engagement doesn't drop >10% |
| Phase 2 | Expand to 25% of users | ~50M users | 8 weeks | No major creator backlash; anxiety metrics improve |
| Phase 3 | Full rollout with opt-out | All users | Ongoing | Monitor long-term retention and sentiment |

---

## 8. Recommendation

Based on your research, what should the team do?

[ ] **Build it**

[x] **Test first** — Promising but needs validation before full investment

[ ] **Don't build**

[ ] **Pivot**

**One-paragraph justification:**

The behavioral science literature strongly supports the hypothesis that hiding likes will reduce comparison-driven anxiety. Our qualitative and quantitative data confirms that HKU students experience this comparison-anxiety loop. However, the risks (creator backlash, engagement drop) are significant enough that a phased A/B test is warranted before full commitment. Instagram's own 2019 hidden-likes test in Canada provides a precedent, but their results weren't publicly conclusive. We recommend a 4-week A/B test with 10,000 users, measuring both well-being outcomes (our goal) and engagement metrics (business risk). If comparison reports drop below 50% without engagement dropping more than 10%, proceed to broader rollout.
