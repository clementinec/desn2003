We conducted a mixed-methods study with 16 participants with visual or motor impairments to understand their experiences with VUIs.

We propose design recommendations for more inclusive VUIs, including customizable feedback options and adaptive speech recognition.”"

We analyzed 45 papers published between 2010 and 2020, focusing on design considerations, user experiences, and challenges. Our findings indicate that while VUIs can enhance independence for older adults, current designs often do not adequately address age-related changes in cognition, hearing, and speech production. Moreover, privacy concerns and technology acceptance remain significant barriers to VUI adoption among this population. We identify key research gaps and provide a roadmap for future work in designing age-friendly VUIs.”"

This study examines VUI preferences across three cultures: American, Korean, and Brazilian. Through surveys (n=300) and interviews (n=30), we found significant differences in command phrasing, error recovery strategies, and personification preferences. However, current VUI design frameworks do not adequately account for these cultural variations, potentially leading to reduced usability and user satisfaction in non-Western contexts.
