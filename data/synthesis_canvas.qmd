# Synthesis Canvas — Worked Example

**Your Name:** Alex Chen **Date:** Week 9

**Research Question:** What is the relationship between Instagram like-checking frequency and daily anxiety levels among HKU undergraduate students?

---

## 1. What Data Do You Have?

| Data Type | Source | Volume |
|:----------|:-------|:-------|
| **Qualitative** | Semi-structured interviews | 12 interviews / 45 pages of transcripts |
| **Quantitative** | Online survey (Qualtrics) | n = 127 valid responses |
| **Other** | Diary entries (subset) | 8 participants x 14 days |

---

## 2. Qualitative Synthesis: From Quotes to Themes

**Step 1: Pull Key Quotes**

| Quote | Who Said It | Initial Code |
|:------|:------------|:-------------|
| "I check within 10 minutes of posting. I can't help it." | P03 | Compulsive checking |
| "If it doesn't hit 100 likes, I feel like a failure." | P07 | Threshold anxiety |
| "I deleted a post because it only got 30 likes. That's embarrassing." | P11 | Deletion behavior |
| "I know it's stupid, but I compare my likes to my friends' likes." | P05 | Social comparison |
| "When I get a lot of likes, I feel good for maybe an hour. Then it fades." | P02 | Temporary validation |

**Step 2: Group Into Themes**

| Theme | Codes Included | # of Participants |
|:------|:---------------|:------------------|
| Theme 1: **Compulsive checking loop** | Compulsive checking, can't resist, habitual | 10/12 |
| Theme 2: **Like thresholds as self-worth** | Threshold anxiety, deletion behavior, embarrassment | 8/12 |
| Theme 3: **Social comparison with peers** | Social comparison, competitive feelings | 9/12 |

---

## 3. Quantitative Synthesis: From Numbers to Patterns

**Descriptive Statistics:**

| Variable | Mean | SD | Range |
|:---------|:-----|:---|:------|
| Daily like-checking frequency | 4.2 times | 2.8 | 0 to 15 |
| GAD-7 anxiety score | 8.4 | 4.1 | 0 to 21 |

**Key Comparisons/Correlations:**

| Finding | Statistic | Significant? |
|:--------|:----------|:------------:|
| Like-checking frequency ↔ GAD-7 score | r = 0.42, p < .001 | [x] Yes [ ] No |
| High-checkers (5+/day) vs low-checkers (<2/day) anxiety | t = 3.2, p = .002 | [x] Yes [ ] No |

---

## 4. Triangulation: Do Qual and Quant Agree?

| Finding | Qual Evidence | Quant Evidence | Agreement? |
|:--------|:--------------|:---------------|:----------:|
| More checking = more anxiety | 10/12 described anxiety around checking | r = 0.42 correlation | [x] Yes [ ] No [ ] Partial |
| Social comparison drives checking | 9/12 mentioned comparing to friends | 67% selected "comparing to others" as motivation | [x] Yes [ ] No [ ] Partial |
| Likes tied to self-worth | "I feel like a failure" (P07) | Not directly measured | [ ] Yes [ ] No [x] Partial |

**Where they disagree:** Qualitative data suggests checking causes anxiety; quantitative data only shows correlation (can't prove direction).

**What might explain the disagreement:** Cross-sectional survey can't establish causality. Some participants may be anxious people who also happen to check more (reverse causation).

---

## 5. The "So What?" Test

| Finding | So What? (Implication) |
|:--------|:-----------------------|
| r = 0.42 correlation between checking and anxiety | Moderate relationship — not deterministic, but meaningful signal for designers |
| 67% check to compare with others | Hiding like counts might reduce comparison triggers |
| 10/12 describe compulsive checking | Design interventions (friction, delays) might help break the loop |

---

## 6. Limitations — Be Honest

| Limitation | How It Affects Your Findings |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------|
| Sample: HKU students only | May not generalize to other populations or cultures |
| Method: Self-report data | Actual checking frequency may differ; social desirability bias |
| Context: Correlational design | Cannot prove that checking *causes* anxiety |

---

## 7. From Findings to Recommendations

| Finding | Design/Research Recommendation |
|:--------|:-------------------------------|
| Compulsive checking loop | Test "check later" nudges that add friction after posting |
| Social comparison drives behavior | Hide like counts by default; show only to poster |
| Temporary validation effect | Research whether delayed like visibility reduces anxiety |

---

## 8. One-Sentence Summary

**My research found that** Instagram like-checking frequency is moderately correlated with anxiety (r=0.42) among HKU students, driven primarily by social comparison,

**which matters because** it provides evidence that engagement metrics affect mental health in Asian university populations (previously understudied),

**and suggests that** design interventions like hidden likes or checking friction could reduce comparison-driven anxiety — but longitudinal research is needed to establish causality.
