## 1: From Osman & Abramson to Thermal Comfort Studies: Evidence and Narrative in Research  

**A Data-Driven Qualitative Review in Architectural Research**  


---

## 2: What makes a story credible? 
### How do we transform raw facts into a compelling narrative?

---

## 3: Let's open with some ideas from Osman & Abramson

- **Osman’s Idea:**
  - Evidence is not self-explanatory.
  - Facts become “evidence” when selectively assembled into a narrative.
- **Abramson’s Contribution:**
  - Advocates for an “undetermined history.”
  - Emphasizes embracing ambiguity, accident, and counter-narratives.
  
*Leverage these ideas as the thread that stitches our session together.*

---

## 4: Session Overview & Objectives
- **Our Focus:**
  - Use Osman & Abramson as theoretical anchors to examine research narratives.
  - Case study: “A Data-Driven Qualitative Review of Thermal Comfort Studies.”
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Understand roles of primary vs. secondary data.
  - Recognize how narrative is constructed—and what is omitted.
  - Develop strategies for critical, reflexive evidence gathering.

---

## 5: Introduction & Context Setting
- **Exploration:**
  - How evidence and narrative work together in research.
  - Our case study is the provided draft on thermal comfort studies.
- **Focus:**
  - Examining how the draft uses different data types to build its narrative.

---

## 6: Dissecting the Draft’s Methodology
- **Data Collection:**
  - **Primary Data:** Field measurements, surveys, direct observations.
  - **Secondary Data:** Established databases (e.g., ASHRAE, Chinese TCDB) and literature.
- **Systematic Approach:**
  - Literature screening, numerical evaluation criteria (scores 0–3).
  - Mapping personal (age, gender, BMI) and contextual parameters.
  
*This method exemplifies how facts are mobilized into evidence, as Osman suggests.*

## 7: Mapping between perception and numbers: A Quantitative Review

**What benefits and drawbacks do you see in using numerical scoring to convert raw data into a narrative?**

---

## 8: Primary vs. Secondary Data Sources
- **Primary Data:**
  - Direct measurements (e.g., temperature, humidity).
  - First-hand surveys and observations.
- **Secondary Data:**
  - Data from previous studies and databases.
  - Provides context and broadens scope.
  
*The draft combines both to create a layered narrative.*

---

## 9: How Did We Do This in Our Manuscript?

- **Leveraging Secondary Data:**
  - Utilized established thermal comfort databases (ASHRAE & Chinese TCDB) as our primary sources.
  - Compiled 88+ articles to form our evidence base.
- **Systematic Data Evaluation:**
  - Applied a numerical scoring system (0–3) to assess personal, contextual, and PMV parameters.
  - Enabled structured comparison and identification of gaps across studies.
- **Constructing the Narrative:**
  - Integrated diverse data points to build a coherent story that supports our hypothesis.
  - Demonstrated how selection and framing of secondary data can drive new insights.
- **Testament to Methodology:**
  - Our approach shows that robust secondary data can be effectively leveraged.
  - Aligns with Osman’s and Abramson’s ideas on how evidence is reinterpreted into a narrative.

## 10: Critically Assessing Our Data Setup
- **Maintain Critical Awareness:**
  - **Triangulation:** Validate findings by comparing multiple sources.
  - **Reflexivity:** Regularly question data selection and categorization.
  - **Iterative Review:** Continuously refine data collection and narrative as new evidence emerges.
- **Draft’s Limitations:**
  - Inconsistent classifications and mapping issues.
  - Underrepresentation of certain demographics.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Develop standardized classification/predictive frameworks.
  - Incorporate mixed-method approaches.
  
*This process embodies the critical reflection championed by Osman and Abramson.*

---

## 11: How can we ensure our data-driven narratives remain robust and adaptable as new evidence emerges?

---

## 12: Conclusion & Key Takeaways
- **Summary:**
  - Evidence transforms into narrative through careful selection and interpretation.
  - Our case study demonstrates both the potential and limitations in this process.
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Balance rigorous data collection with reflexive narrative construction.
  - Be aware of what is included—and omitted—to strengthen research credibility.
  - Osman and Abramson remind us to remain open to alternative interpretations.
  
*Final Reflection:*  
**“As researchers, how do we balance the rigor of data collection with the interpretive nature of narrative construction?”**
