# DESN2003 Weeks 4-12: Fix List

Detailed issues and fixes needed for each week to match the quality standard of Weeks 1-3.

---

## Week 4: Research Questions

**Current title:** "Literature Review Extended by Advanced Methods"
**Should be:** "Research Questions" (per index)

### Issues
1. **Title mismatch** - Content doesn't match index topic
2. **No opening callback** to Week 3
3. **No learning objectives**
4. **Content scatter** - Covers Zotero, citation styles, HKU library, research questions, scoping all in one
5. **No throughline** - Doesn't connect to student's own research gap
6. **No key takeaways**
7. **Ends abruptly** with "Take five minutes to look at your own submission"
8. **Doc 0 due this week** but no clear connection

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Rename to "Research Questions: From Gap to Inquiry"
- [ ] Add opening: "Last week you mapped the landscape. Now: how do you turn your gap into a question?"
- [ ] Add learning objectives (formulate RQ, evaluate RQ quality, scope appropriately)
- [ ] Move Zotero/citation content to Week 3 or make it supplementary
- [ ] Focus content on: What makes a good RQ? → Types of RQs → Scoping → Evaluating RQs
- [ ] Add activity: "Refine YOUR research question" using their Doc 0
- [ ] Add assessment connection: Doc 0 feedback, Doc 0.1 preview
- [ ] Add key takeaways + bridge to Week 5 (Methods)

### Estimated Work
Major revision - essentially rewrite with focused content

---

## Week 5: Methods I (Research Gaps + Qualitative)

**Current title:** "Research Gap - What they are and how to identify them"
**Should be:** "Methods I" (per index)

### Issues
1. **Title mismatch** - Research gaps should be in Week 2-3, not Week 5
2. **Flashback references wrong weeks** (says W4: SOTA Literature Research)
3. **Content overlap** - Research gaps already covered in Week 2/3 drafts
4. **Mixed focus** - Gaps + Qualitative research + Sentence completion
5. **No learning objectives**
6. **No key takeaways**
7. **Good activity** (Lightning Gap Pitches) but disconnected
8. **Ends awkwardly** with sentence completion intro

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Rename to "Methods I: Qualitative Research"
- [ ] Remove/relocate research gap content (already in Week 2-3)
- [ ] Add opening callback: "You have a research question. Now: how will you answer it?"
- [ ] Add learning objectives (understand qual methods, choose appropriate method, design interview/observation)
- [ ] Focus on: Qualitative overview → Interviews → Observations → Ethnography → Case studies
- [ ] Keep Lightning Pitches but reframe as "Pitch your METHOD not just gap"
- [ ] Connect to: "What method will YOU use for Doc 0.2?"
- [ ] Add key takeaways + bridge to Week 6 (Methods II)

### Estimated Work
Significant revision - refocus content, remove duplicates

---

## Week 6: Methods II

**Current title:** "Evidence and Narrative in Research"
**Should be:** "Methods II" (per index)

### Issues
1. **Very short** (163 lines)
2. **Academic paper focus** (Osman & Abramson + Thermal Comfort) - too niche
3. **No opening callback**
4. **No learning objectives**
5. **No activities**
6. **No key takeaways**
7. **Doc 0.1 due this week** but no reminder
8. **Numbered slides** (## 1:, ## 2:) - inconsistent with other weeks

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Rename to "Methods II: Quantitative & Mixed Methods"
- [ ] Add opening: "Last week: qualitative. This week: quantitative + combining both"
- [ ] Add learning objectives (understand quant methods, design surveys, understand mixed methods)
- [ ] Replace academic paper deep-dive with broader methods content
- [ ] Cover: Surveys → Experiments → A/B testing (recap) → Mixed methods → When to use what
- [ ] Add activity: "Design a data collection plan for YOUR research"
- [ ] Add assessment connection: Doc 0.1 due this week!
- [ ] Add key takeaways + bridge to Week 7 (Analysis)
- [ ] Remove slide numbering (## 1:, ## 2:)

### Estimated Work
Major revision - expand significantly with new content

---

## Week 6_P / Week 7a: Data Collection Methods

**Current title:** "Data, Data, Data, Collection Methodologies"
**Listed as:** Week Seven (Part 1)

### Issues
1. **Confusing placement** - Is this Week 6 Part 2 or Week 7 Part 1?
2. **Very dense** - 352 lines of detailed methods
3. **No opening callback**
4. **No learning objectives**
5. **Good practical content** but overwhelming
6. **Has activity** at end (jay-walking study) but buried
7. **No key takeaways**
8. **References section** is good but unusual for slides

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Clarify placement in course sequence (merge with Week 6 or make it Week 7)
- [ ] Add opening callback and objectives
- [ ] Chunk content into clearer sections with colored headers
- [ ] Move some detail to supplementary reading
- [ ] Elevate the jay-walking activity - make it more prominent
- [ ] Add throughline: "Which of these methods fits YOUR research?"
- [ ] Add key takeaways

### Estimated Work
Medium revision - restructure and add bookends

---

## Week 7: Analysis (Informational Interviews + KYC)

**Current title:** "Know Your Client (KYC), Working with informational interviews"
**Should be:** "Analysis" (per index) - but content is about interviews

### Issues
1. **Title/content mismatch** - Index says "Analysis" but content is Professional Discovery prep
2. **Doc 0.1 reflection** is time-specific (may be outdated)
3. **Good practical content** on informational interviews
4. **Has activities** (social engineering exercise, mock interview)
5. **Too much content** - mixes interview prep, lit review checklist, research progress, data viz teaser
6. **No clear objectives or takeaways**
7. **Dated deadline references** (Mar 23rd, Apr 23rd)

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Decide: Is this "Analysis" or "Professional Discovery Prep"?
- [ ] If Professional Discovery prep → rename and place appropriately (maybe Week 7-8)
- [ ] If Analysis → replace content with actual analysis methods
- [ ] Remove dated deadline references (use relative: "Due Week X")
- [ ] Add objectives + takeaways
- [ ] Streamline - remove tangential content (data viz teaser, etc.)

### Estimated Work
Significant revision - needs content decision first

---

## Week 8: Research Methodologies (Paradigms + GenAI)

**Current title:** "Research Methodologies in Design, HCI, and Generative AI"
**Index says:** "Writing"

### Issues
1. **Actually well-structured** - has objectives, activities, takeaways
2. **Title mismatch** - Index says "Writing" but this is about paradigms
3. **Very long** (373 lines) - might be too much for one session
4. **Professional Discovery presentations** happen this week per schedule
5. **GenAI focus** is good but may not fit all students
6. **Two activities** with clear instructions - good!

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Reconcile with index - is this Week 8 or different week?
- [ ] May need to split: Paradigms in one week, GenAI research in another
- [ ] Add reminder: "Professional Discovery presentations this week"
- [ ] Add throughline to student's own research
- [ ] Consider: Is this the right week for this content given presentations?

### Estimated Work
Light revision - mostly placement/scheduling issues

3. **Good activities** (peer review, reverse outlining)
4. **No opening callback or objectives**
5. **No key takeaways**
6. **Prof Discovery presentations continue** this week
7. **Data visualization section** feels tacked on at end

### Fixes Needed
- [ ] Rename to match index: "Synthesis" or "Writing & Synthesis"
