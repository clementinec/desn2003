# Let's Start with a Problem {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## Two Students Walk Into Office Hours...

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Student A:**

*"I want to research sustainability in design."*

. . .

- What about sustainability?
- What about design?
- What would you even measure?
- Where would you start?

**This isn't a research project. It's a topic.**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Student B:**

*"I want to understand how material choices in packaging affect Hong Kong consumers' perception of product sustainability."*

. . .

- Specific phenomenon (material choices)
- Defined population (HK consumers)
- Clear outcome (perception)
- You can imagine how to study this

**This is a research question.**
:::

## The Difference Is Everything

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Today's Core Challenge

You've identified a gap. You've mapped the landscape. You submitted Doc 0 this morning.

But **"there's a gap"** still isn't a research project.

The question is: **Can you turn your gap into something you can actually answer?**
:::

. . .

That's what separates students who spin their wheels from students who make progress.

## Where We've Been (Quick Recap)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
**Week 1-2**

Instinct → Validation

*"I think there's a problem here"*
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Week 3**

Landscape mapping

*"Here's what already exists"*
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Week 4 (Today)**

Gap → Question

*"Here's what I'll actually investigate"*
:::
:::

## Today's Roadmap

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Doc 0 Reflection** — Common patterns and feedback
2. **What Makes a Research Question?** — Anatomy of a good RQ
3. **Types of Research Questions** — Descriptive, relational, causal
4. **Scoping Your Question** — Not too broad, not too narrow
5. **Activity: Refine YOUR Research Question**
6. **Looking Ahead** — From question to method (Doc 0.1)
:::

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

::: {.incremental}
1. **Articulate** the difference between a topic, a gap, and a research question
2. **Formulate** a clear, focused research question from your identified gap
3. **Evaluate** whether a research question is answerable within your constraints
4. **Scope** a question appropriately (not too broad, not too narrow)
:::

# From Topic to Question {background-color="#A8DADC"}

## Doc 0: You Just Submitted — Now What?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Submitted Before Class?

Good. Feedback will come within the week.

Today's session will help you **refine your thinking** — so when you get feedback, you'll know how to act on it.
:::

. . .

**Common patterns we'll address today:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Topic ≠ Question** — Many abstracts describe an area but don't ask something specific
- **Gap ≠ Question** — "This hasn't been studied" isn't the same as "What happens when...?"
- **Scope issues** — Too broad ("sustainability in design") or too narrow (trivial)
:::

---

## The Progression: Topic → Gap → Question

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Topic
*An area of interest*

"Social media and mental health"

- Too broad to research
- Could go anywhere
- Not actionable
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Gap
*Something missing in the landscape*

"Little research on how design interventions reduce Instagram-related anxiety"

- More focused
- Shows what's missing
- But still not a question
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Research Question
*A specific, answerable inquiry*

"How do intentional friction features (like scroll limits) affect reported anxiety levels in young adult Instagram users?"

- Specific
- Answerable
- Testable
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Your Task Today
Move from gap → question. Make it specific enough to answer.
:::

# What Makes a Research Question? {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Anatomy of a Good Research Question

A strong research question is:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**FINER Criteria**

- **F**easible — Can you actually do this?
- **I**nteresting — Do you (and others) care?
- **N**ovel — Does it add something new?
- **E**thical — Can it be done responsibly?
- **R**elevant — Does it matter to the field?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Practical Checks**

- Can you answer it in one semester?
- Do you have access to the data/people needed?
- Is it specific enough to guide your methods?
- Is it open enough to allow discovery?
:::
:::

---

## Good vs. Bad Research Questions

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Weak Questions

- "What is sustainable design?"
  - *Too broad, definitional*

- "Is Instagram bad for mental health?"
  - *Too binary, too broad*

- "Why don't people recycle?"
  - *Too vague, no focus*

- "Will my app be successful?"
  - *Not researchable*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Strong Questions

- "How do material choices affect user perception of sustainability in product packaging?"
  - *Specific, testable*

- "What design features correlate with reduced self-reported anxiety in social media apps?"
  - *Focused, measurable*

- "What barriers do HK residents cite for recycling participation?"
  - *Bounded, answerable*

- "How do users perceive the usefulness of [specific feature] in [context]?"
  - *Evaluable*
:::
:::

## The Question Formulation Framework

**Start with your gap, then build the question:**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Who** is the population? (e.g., "young adult Instagram users")
2. **What** is the phenomenon? (e.g., "intentional friction features")
3. **Where** is the context? (e.g., "in daily social media use")
4. **When** is the timeframe? (e.g., "over a two-week period")
5. **How/What** is the inquiry? (e.g., "affect reported anxiety levels")
:::

. . .

**Template:**

> "How does [phenomenon] affect/influence/relate to [outcome] among [population] in [context]?"

> "What [factors/features/experiences] contribute to [outcome] for [population]?"

# Types of Research Questions {background-color="#4ECDC4"}

## Three Main Types

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Descriptive

*What is happening?*

- Maps a phenomenon
- Documents experiences
- Establishes baseline

**Example:**
"What are the main frustrations HK design students report when using AI tools for coursework?"

**Methods:** Surveys, interviews, observation
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Relational

*What goes with what?*

- Explores associations
- Identifies patterns
- Doesn't prove causation

**Example:**
"Is there a relationship between time spent on Instagram and self-reported productivity among students?"

**Methods:** Correlational surveys, analytics
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Causal

*Does X cause Y?*

- Tests interventions
- Requires control
- Strongest claims

**Example:**
"Does implementing a 'slow feed' feature reduce anxiety compared to standard feed?"

**Methods:** Experiments, A/B tests
:::
:::

---

## Matching Question Type to Your Project

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## For a One-Semester Project

**Descriptive and relational questions** are usually most feasible.

Causal questions require controlled experiments, which may be difficult to set up in your timeframe. But you can do exploratory work that *suggests* causal relationships.
:::

. . .

**Think about your Doc 0 topic:**

::: {.incremental}
- What type of question are you asking?
- Is it descriptive (what's happening)?
- Is it relational (what correlates)?
- Is it causal (what causes what)?
- Is the question type realistic for your resources?
:::

# Scoping Your Question {background-color="#FF6B6B"}

## The Goldilocks Problem

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Too Broad

"How does technology affect design?"

- Can't answer in a lifetime
- No clear method
- No clear outcome

**Result:** Paralysis
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Too Narrow

"Does the color blue on this specific button increase clicks by 3% on Tuesdays?"

- Trivial findings
- Limited contribution
- Who cares?

**Result:** So what?
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
### Just Right

"How do color choices in CTA buttons affect conversion rates in e-commerce checkout flows?"

- Specific enough to study
- Broad enough to matter
- Clear path to method

**Result:** Actionable insight
:::
:::

---

## Scoping Dimensions

Use these to narrow or broaden your question:

| Dimension | Broader | Narrower |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Population** | "Users" | "HK university students aged 18-24" |
| **Context** | "Social media" | "Instagram Stories feature" |
| **Timeframe** | "Over time" | "During a 2-week study period" |
| **Geography** | "Globally" | "In Hong Kong" |
| **Phenomenon** | "User engagement" | "Double-tap behavior on posts" |

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Rule of Thumb
If you can't imagine how you'd collect data to answer it, it's probably too broad. If the answer seems obvious or trivial, it's probably too narrow.
:::

---

## Exercise: Scope Check

**Which of these is better scoped? Why?**

::: {.incremental}
1. "How does social media affect teenagers?"
   - *Too broad: which platform? which teens? affect what?*

2. "How does Instagram's Explore algorithm affect content discovery satisfaction among HK university students?"
   - *Better: specific platform, specific population, specific outcome*

3. "Does the third post in Instagram Explore get more engagement than the fourth post?"
   - *Too narrow: trivial, limited insight*
:::

# Activity: Refine Your Research Question {background-color="#FFE66D"}

## Your Task (20 minutes)

**Working individually or in pairs:**

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Start with your Doc 0 topic/gap** (or the idea you're considering)

2. **Draft a research question** using this format:
   - "How does [X] affect/relate to [Y] among [population] in [context]?"
   - OR "What [factors] contribute to [outcome] for [population]?"

3. **Check your question against:**
   - Is it specific enough? (Can you imagine collecting data?)
   - Is it broad enough? (Does the answer matter?)
   - Is it feasible? (Can you do this in one semester?)
   - What type is it? (Descriptive/Relational/Causal)

4. **Prepare to share:** Your question + one concern you have about it
:::

---

## Peer Feedback (10 minutes)

**Share your question with a neighbor. Give feedback:**

::: {.nonincremental}
- Can you understand the question on first reading?
- Is it too broad or too narrow?
- What method might answer this? (If you can't imagine one, it may be too vague)
- What's one way to make it sharper?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Feedback Frames
- "I think the question is clear, but I'm not sure how you'd measure [X]..."
- "Could you narrow the population to make it more feasible?"
- "What if you focused on [specific aspect] instead of [broad area]?"
:::

---

## Debrief: Let's Hear Some Questions

::: {.incremental}
- What questions did you come up with?
- What was hardest about formulating the question?
- How did peer feedback help?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Remember
Your research question will evolve. The literature review (Doc 0.1) often reveals that your question needs adjusting. That's normal and expected.
:::

# Looking Ahead {background-color="#457B9D"}

## From Question to Method

Once you have a clear research question, you can ask:

::: {.incremental}
- **What data would answer this?** (numbers? words? observations?)
- **Who has this data?** (users? databases? you need to collect it?)
- **How would you get it?** (surveys? interviews? experiments?)
- **What would "an answer" look like?** (statistics? themes? comparison?)
:::

. . .

This is exactly what **Doc 0.1 (Literature Review)** prepares you for—and what **Doc 0.2 (Collecting Evidence)** will execute.

---

## The Research Question Cascade

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Your Question Shapes Everything

**Research Question** ↓

**Literature Review** — What's already known about this question?

**Methodology** — How will I answer this question?

**Data Collection** — What evidence addresses this question?

**Analysis** — What does the evidence say?

**Conclusion** — Did I answer the question?
:::

A well-formed question makes every subsequent step clearer.

---

## Upcoming Assessments

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Just Submitted
**Doc 0: Extended Abstract**

- Feedback will be released soon
- Use it to refine your question
- Don't panic if you need to adjust
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Coming Up
**Doc 0.1: Literature Review**

- Due: Week 6 (Mar 3)
- Now that you have a question, search for what's already known
- Your lit review should help you refine the question further

## Next Week: Methods I
We'll cover qualitative research methods—interviews, observations, ethnography. Start thinking: **What method fits YOUR question?**
:::

# Key Takeaways {background-color="#457B9D"}

## What We Learned Today

::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Topic ≠ Gap ≠ Question** — A research question is specific and answerable, not just an area of interest

2. **Good questions are FINER** — Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant

3. **Three types of questions** — Descriptive (what?), Relational (what correlates?), Causal (what causes?)

4. **Scope matters** — Not too broad (can't answer), not too narrow (doesn't matter)

5. **Your question shapes everything** — It determines your methods, data, and what counts as an answer

6. **Questions evolve** — It's okay to refine as you learn more from the literature
